<h2>NOTE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The final word in the title of this volume refers to the DIVINE POWER
in every human being, the recognition of which is the secret to all
success and happiness.&nbsp; It is this idea which many of the verses
endeavour to illustrate.</p>
<p>E. W. W.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE QUEEN&rsquo;S LAST RIDE<br />(Written on the day of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
funeral)</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Queen is taking a drive to-day,<br />They have hung with purple
the carriage-way,<br />They have dressed with purple the royal track<br />Where
the Queen goes forth and never comes back.</p>
<p>Let no man labour as she goes by<br />On her last appearance to mortal
eye:<br />With heads uncovered let all men wait<br />For the Queen to
pass, in her regal state.</p>
<p>Army and Navy shall lead the way<br />For that wonderful coach of
the Queen&rsquo;s to-day.<br />Kings and Princes and Lords of the land<br />Shall
ride behind her, a humble band;<br />And over the city and over the
world<br />Shall the Flags of all Nations be half-mast-furled,<br />For
the silent lady of royal birth<br />Who is riding away from the Courts
of earth,<br />Riding away from the world&rsquo;s unrest<br />To a mystical
goal, on a secret quest.</p>
<p>Though in royal splendour she drives through town,<br />Her robes
are simple, she wears no crown:<br />And yet she wears one, for, widowed
no more,<br />She is crowned with the love that has gone before,<br />And
crowned with the love she has left behind<br />In the hidden depths
of each mourner&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Bow low your heads - lift your hearts on high -<br />The Queen in
silence is driving by!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE MEETING OF THE CENTURIES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A curious vision on mine eyes unfurled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the deep night.&nbsp; I saw, or seemed to see,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two
Centuries meet, and sit down vis-&agrave;-vis<br />Across the great
round table of the world:<br />One with suggested sorrows in his mien,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
on his brow the furrowed lines of thought;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
one whose glad expectant presence brought<br />A glow and radiance from
the realms unseen.</p>
<p>Hand clasped with hand, in silence for a space<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Centuries sat; the sad old eyes of one<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As grave
paternal eyes regard a son)<br />Gazing upon that other eager face.<br />And
then a voice, as cadenceless and gray<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the
sea&rsquo;s monody in winter time,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingled with
tones melodious, as the chime<br />Of bird choirs, singing in the dawns
of May.</p>
<p>THE OLD CENTURY SPEAKS</p>
<p>By you, Hope stands.&nbsp; With me, Experience walks.<br />Like a
fair jewel in a faded box,<br />In my tear-rusted heart, sweet Pity
lies.<br />For all the dreams that look forth from your eyes,<br />And
those bright-hued ambitions, which I know<br />Must fall like leaves
and perish, in Time&rsquo;s snow,<br />(Even as my soul&rsquo;s garden
stands bereft,)<br />I give you pity! &rsquo;tis the one gift left.</p>
<p>THE NEW CENTURY</p>
<p>Nay, nay, good friend! not pity, but Godspeed,<br />Here in the morning
of my life I need.<br />Counsel, and not condolence; smiles, not tears,<br />To
guide me through the channels of the years.<br />Oh, I am blinded by
the blaze of light<br />That shines upon me from the Infinite.<br />Blurred
is my vision by the close approach<br />To unseen shores, whereon the
times encroach.</p>
<p>THE OLD CENTURY</p>
<p>Illusion, all illusion.&nbsp; List and hear<br />The Godless cannons,
booming far and near.<br />Flaunting the flag of Unbelief, with Greed<br />For
pilot, lo! the pirate age in speed<br />Bears on to ruin.&nbsp; War&rsquo;s
most hideous crimes<br />Besmirch the record of these modern times.<br />Degenerate
is the world I leave to you, -<br />My happiest speech to earth will
be - adieu.</p>
<p>THE NEW CENTURY</p>
<p>You speak as one too weary to be just.<br />I hear the guns - I see
the greed and lust.<br />The death throes of a giant evil fill<br />The
air with riot and confusion.&nbsp; Ill<br />Ofttimes makes fallow ground
for Good; and Wrong<br />Builds Right&rsquo;s foundation, when it grows
too strong.<br />Pregnant with promise is the hour, and grand<br />The
trust you leave in my all-willing hand.</p>
<p>THE OLD CENTURY</p>
<p>As one who throws a flickering taper&rsquo;s ray<br />To light departing
feet, my shadowed way<br />You brighten with your faith.&nbsp; Faith
makes the man<br />Alas, that my poor foolish age outran<br />Its early
trust in God!&nbsp; The death of art<br />And progress follows, when
the world&rsquo;s hard heart<br />Casts out religion.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
the human brain<br />Men worship now, and heaven, to them, means - gain.</p>
<p>THE NEW CENTURY</p>
<p>Faith is not dead, tho&rsquo; priest and creed may pass,<br />For
thought has leavened the whole unthinking mass,<br />And man looks now
to find the God within.<br />We shall talk more of love, and less of
sin,<br />In this new era.&nbsp; We are drawing near<br />Unatlassed
boundaries of a larger sphere.<br />With awe, I wait, till Science leads
us on,<br />Into the full effulgence of its dawn.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>DEATH HAS CROWNED HIM A MARTYR<br />(Written on the day of President
McKinley&rsquo;s death)</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the midst of sunny waters, lo! the mighty Ship of State<br />Staggers,
bruised and torn and wounded by a derelict of fate,<br />One that drifted
from its moorings in the anchorage of hate.</p>
<p>On the deck our noble Pilot, in the glory of his prime,<br />Lies
in woe-impelling silence, dead before his hour or time,<br />Victim
of a mind self-centred in a Godless fool of crime.</p>
<p>One of earth&rsquo;s dissension-breeders, one of Hate&rsquo;s unreasoning
tools,<br />In the annals of the ages, when the world&rsquo;s hot anger
cools,<br />He who sought for Crime&rsquo;s distinction shall be known
as Chief of Fools.</p>
<p>In the annals of the ages, he who had no thought of fame<br />(Keeping
on the path of duty, caring not for praise or blame),<br />Close beside
the deathless Lincoln, writ in light, will shine his name.</p>
<p>Youth proclaimed him as a hero; time, a statesman; love, a man;<br />Death
has crowned him as a martyr, - so from goal to goal he ran,<br />Knowing
all the sum of glory that a human life may span.</p>
<p>He was chosen by the people; not an accident of birth<br />Made him
ruler of a nation, but his own intrinsic worth.<br />Fools may govern
over kingdoms - not republics of the earth.</p>
<p>He has raised the lovers&rsquo; standard by his loyalty and faith,<br />He
has shown how virile manhood may keep free from scandal&rsquo;s breath.<br />He
has gazed, with trust unshaken, in the awful eyes of Death.</p>
<p>In the mighty march of progress he has sought to do his best.<br />Let
his enemies be silent, as we lay him down to rest,<br />And may God
assuage the anguish of one suffering woman&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>GRIEF</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As the funeral train with its honoured dead<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
its mournful way went sweeping,<br />While a sorrowful nation bowed
its head<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whole world joined in weeping,<br />I
thought, as I looked on the solemn sight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the one fond heart despairing,<br />And I said to myself, as in truth
I might,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How sad must be this <i>sharing</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To share the living with even Fame,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a
heart that is only human,<br />Is hard, when Glory asserts her claim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
a bold, insistent woman;<br />Yet a great, grand passion can put aside<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
stay each selfish emotion,<br />And watch, with a pleasure that springs
from pride,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its rival - the world&rsquo;s devotion.</p>
<p>But Death should render to love its own,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
my heart bowed down and sorrowed<br />For the stricken woman who wept
alone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While even her <i>dead</i> was borrowed;<br />Borrowed
from her, the bride - the wife -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the world&rsquo;s
last martial honour,<br />As she sat in the gloom of her darkened life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
her widow&rsquo;s grief fresh upon her.</p>
<p>He had shed the glory of Love and Fame<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a golden halo about her;<br />She had shared his triumphs and worn his
name:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, alas! he had died without her.<br />He
had wandered in many a distant realm,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never
had left her behind him,<br />But now, with a spectral shape at the
helm,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had sailed where she could not find
him.</p>
<p>It was only a thought, that came that day<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the midst of the muffled drumming<br />And funeral music and sad display,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
I knew was right and becoming<br />Only a thought as the mourning train<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved,
column after column,<br />Bearing the dead to the burial plain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
a reverence grand as solemn.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ILLUSION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>God and I in space alone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nobody else in
view.<br />&ldquo;And where are the people, O Lord,&rdquo; I said,<br />&ldquo;The
earth below, and the sky o&rsquo;er head,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the dead whom once I knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a dream,&rdquo; God smiled and said -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A
dream that seemed to be true.<br />There were no people, living or dead,<br />There
was no earth, and no sky o&rsquo;erhead;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
was only Myself - in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do I feel no fear,&rdquo; I asked,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Meeting
You here this way?<br />For I have sinned I know full well?<br />And
is there heaven, and is there hell,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is this
the judgment day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, those were but dreams,&rdquo; the Great God said,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dreams,
that have ceased to be.<br />There are no such things as fear or sin,<br />There
is no you - you never have been -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing
at all but <i>Me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ASSERTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I am serenity.&nbsp; Though passions beat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
mighty billows on my helpless heart,<br />I know beyond them lies the
perfect sweet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serenity, which patience can impart.<br />And
when wild tempests in my bosom rage,<br />&ldquo;Peace, peace,&rdquo;
I cry, &ldquo;it is my heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am good health.&nbsp; Though fevers rack my brain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
rude disorders mutilate my strength,<br />A perfect restoration after
pain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know shall be my recompense at length.<br />And
so through grievous day and sleepless night,<br />&ldquo;Health, health,&rdquo;
I cry, &ldquo;it is my own by right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am success.&nbsp; Though hungry, cold, ill-clad,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
wander for awhile, I smile and say,<br />&ldquo;It is but for a time
- I shall be glad<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, for good fortune
comes my way.<br />God is my father, He has wealth untold,<br />His
wealth is mine, health, happiness, and gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>I AM</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I know not whence I came,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not whither
I go;<br />But the fact stands clear that I am here<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
this world of pleasure and woe.<br />And out of the mist and murk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another
truth shines plain -<br />It is my power each day and hour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
add to its joy or its pain.</p>
<p>I know that the earth exists,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is none of
my business why;<br />I cannot find out what it&rsquo;s all about,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
would but waste time to try.<br />My life is a brief, brief thing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
am here for a little space,<br />And while I stay I would like, if I
may,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To brighten and better the place.</p>
<p>The trouble, I think, with us all<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the lack
of a high conceit.<br />If each man thought he was sent to this spot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
make it a bit more sweet,<br />How soon we could gladden the world,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How
easily right all wrong,<br />If nobody shirked, and each one worked<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
help his fellows along!</p>
<p>Cease wondering why you came -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop looking
for faults and flaws;<br />Rise up to-day in your pride and say,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
am part of the First Great Cause!<br />However full the world,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is room for an earnest man.<br />It had need of me, or I would not be
-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here to strengthen the plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WISHING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Do you wish the world were better?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me
tell you what to do:<br />Set a watch upon your actions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep
them always straight and true;<br />Rid your mind of selfish motives;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
your thoughts be clean and high.<br />You can make a little Eden<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the sphere you occupy.</p>
<p>Do you wish the world were wiser?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, suppose
you make a start,<br />By accumulating wisdom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the scrapbook of your heart:<br />Do not waste one page on folly;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live
to learn, and learn to live.<br />If you want to give men knowledge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
must get it, ere you give.</p>
<p>Do you wish the world were happy?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then remember
day by day<br />Just to scatter seeds of kindness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
you pass along the way;<br />For the pleasures of the many<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May
be ofttimes traced to one,<br />As the hand that plants an acorn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelters
armies from the sun.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WE TWO</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two make home of any place we go;<br />We two
find joy in any kind of weather;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if the earth
is clothed in bloom or snow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If summer days invite,
or bleak winds blow,<br />What matters it if we two are together?<br />We
two, we two, we make our world, our weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two make banquets of the plainest fare;<br />In
every cup we find the thrill of pleasure;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
hide with wreaths the furrowed brow of care,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
win to smiles the set lips of despair.<br />For us life always moves
with lilting measure;<br />We two, we two, we make our world, our pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two find youth renewed with every dawn;<br />Each
day holds something of an unknown glory.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We waste
no thought on grief or pleasure gone;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricked
out like hope, time leads us on and on,<br />And thrums upon his harp
new song or story.<br />We two, we two, we find the paths of glory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We two make heaven here on this little earth;<br />We
do not need to wait for realms eternal.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know
the use of tears, know sorrow&rsquo;s worth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
pain for us is always love&rsquo;s rebirth.<br />Our paths lead closely
by the paths supernal;<br />We two, we two, we live in love eternal.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE POET&rsquo;S THEME</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>What is the explanation of the strange silence of American poets
concerning American triumphs on sea and land?<br /><i>Literary Digest.</i></p>
<p>Why should the poet of these pregnant times<br />Be asked to sing
of war&rsquo;s unholy crimes?</p>
<p>To laud and eulogize the trade which thrives<br />On horrid holocausts
of human lives?</p>
<p>Man was a fighting beast when earth was young,<br />And war the only
theme when Homer sung.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twixt might and might the equal contest lay,<br />Not so the
battles of our modern day.</p>
<p>Too often now the conquering hero struts<br />A Gulliver among the
Liliputs.</p>
<p>Success no longer rests on skill or fate,<br />But on the movements
of a syndicate.</p>
<p>Of old men fought and deemed it right and just.<br />To-day the warrior
fights because he must,</p>
<p>And in his secret soul feels shame because<br />He desecrates the
higher manhood&rsquo;s laws</p>
<p>Oh! there are worthier themes for poet&rsquo;s pen<br />In this great
hour, than bloody deeds of men</p>
<p>Or triumphs of one hero (though he be<br />Deserving song for his
humility):</p>
<p>The rights of many - not the worth of one;<br />The coming issues
- not the battle done;</p>
<p>The awful opulence, and awful need;<br />The rise of brotherhood
- the fall of greed,</p>
<p>The soul of man replete with God&rsquo;s own force,<br />The call
&ldquo;to heights,&rdquo; and not the cry &ldquo;to horse,&rdquo; -</p>
<p>Are there not better themes in this great age<br />For pen of poet,
or for voice of sage</p>
<p>Than those old tales of killing?&nbsp; Song is dumb<br />Only that
greater song in time may come.</p>
<p>When comes the bard, he whom the world waits for,<br />He will not
sing of War.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SONG OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>All the aim of life is just<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to
God.<br />Spirit casting off its dust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting
back to God.<br />Every grief we have to bear<br />Disappointment, cross,
despair<br />Each is but another stair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing
back to God.</p>
<p>Step by step and mile by mile -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back
to God;<br />Nothing else is worth the while -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting
back to God.<br />Light and shadow fill each day<br />Joys and sorrows
pass away,<br />Smile at all, and smiling, say,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting
back to God.</p>
<p>Do not wear a mournful face<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to
God;<br />Scatter sunshine on the place<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going
back to God;<br />Take what pleasure you can find,<br />But where&rsquo;er
your paths may wind.<br />Keep the purpose well in mind, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting
back to God.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WOMANHOOD</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>She must be honest, both in thought and deed,<br />Of generous impulse,
and above all greed;<br />Not seeking praise, or place, or power, or
pelf,<br />But life&rsquo;s best blessings for her higher self,<br />Which
means the best for all.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
must have faith,<br />To make good friends of Trouble, Pain, and Death,<br />And
understand their message.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
should be<br />As redolent with tender sympathy<br />As is a rose with
fragrance.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerfulness<br />Should
be her mantle, even though her dress<br />May be of Sorrow&rsquo;s weaving.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
her face<br />A loyal nature leaves its seal of grace,<br />And chastity
is in her atmosphere.<br />Not that chill chastity which seems austere<br />(Like
untrod snow-peaks, lovely to behold<br />Till once attained - then barren,
loveless, cold);<br />But the white flame that feeds upon the soul<br />And
lights the pathway to a peaceful goal.<br />A sense of humour, and a
touch of mirth,<br />To brighten up the shadowy spots of earth;<br />And
pride that passes evil - choosing good.<br />All these unite in perfect
womanhood.</p>

<h2>MORNING PRAYER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Let me to-day do something that shall take<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
little sadness from the world&rsquo;s vast store,<br />And may I be
so favoured as to make<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy&rsquo;s too scanty
sum a little more<br />Let me not hurt, by any selfish deed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
thoughtless word, the heart of foe or friend;<br />Nor would I pass,
unseeing, worthy need,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sin by silence when
I should defend.<br />However meagre be my worldly wealth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
me give something that shall aid my. kind -<br />A word of courage,
or a thought of health,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropped as I pass for
troubled hearts to find.<br />Let me to-night look back across the span<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt
dawn and dark, and to my conscience say -<br />Because of some good
act to beast or man -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The world is better
that I lived to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Oh! I hear the people calling through the day time and the night
time,<br />They are calling, they are crying for the coming of the right
time.<br />It behooves you, men and women, it behooves you to be heeding,<br />For
there lurks a note of menace underneath their plaintive pleading.</p>
<p>Let the land usurpers listen, let the greedy-hearted ponder,<br />On
the meaning of the murmur, rising here and swelling yonder,<br />Swelling
louder, waxing stronger, like a storm-fed stream that courses<br />Through
the valleys, down abysses, growing, gaining with new forces.</p>
<p>Day by day the river widens, that great river of opinion,<br />And
its torrent beats and plunges at the base of greed&rsquo;s dominion.<br />Though
you dam it by oppression and fling golden bridges o&rsquo;er it,<br />Yet
the day and hour advances when in fright you&rsquo;ll flee before it.</p>
<p>Yes, I hear the people calling, through the night time and the day
time,<br />Wretched toilers in life&rsquo;s autumn, weary young ones
in life&rsquo;s May time -<br />They are crying, they are calling for
their share of work and pleasure;<br />You are heaping high your coffers
while you give them scanty measure, -<br />You have stolen God&rsquo;s
wide acres, just to glut your swollen purses -<br />Oh! restore them
to His children ere their pleading turns to curses.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE WORLD GROWS BETTER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Oh! the earth is full of sinning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of trouble
and of woe,<br />But the devil makes an inning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every
time we say it&rsquo;s so.<br />And the way to set him scowling,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
to put him back a pace,<br />Is to stop this stupid growling,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
to look things in the face.</p>
<p>If you glance at history&rsquo;s pages,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
all lands and eras known,<br />You will find the buried ages<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far
more wicked than our own.<br />As you scan each word and letter.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
will realise it more,<br />That the world to-day is better<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than
it ever was before.</p>
<p>There is much that needs amending<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present
time, no doubt;<br />There is right that needs amending,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is wrong needs crushing out.<br />And we hear the groans and curses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the poor who starve and die,<br />While the men with swollen purses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the place of hearts go by.</p>
<p>But in spite of all the trouble<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That obscures
the sun to-day,<br />Just remember it was double<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the ages passed away.<br />And those wrongs shall all be righted,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good
shall dominate the land,<br />For the darkness now is lighted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
the torch in Science&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Forth from little motes in Chaos,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have
come to what we are;<br />And no evil force can stay us -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
shall mount from star to star,<br />We shall break each bond and fetter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
has bound us heretofore;<br />And the earth is surely better<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than
it ever was before.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A MAN&rsquo;S IDEAL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A lovely little keeper of the home,<br />Absorbed in menu books,
yet erudite<br />When I need counsel; quick at repartee<br />And slow
to anger.&nbsp; Modest as a flower,<br />Yet scintillant and radiant
as a star.<br />Unmercenary in her mould of mind,<br />While opulent
and dainty in her tastes.<br />A nature generous and free, albeit<br />The
incarnation of economy.<br />She must be chaste as proud Diana was,<br />Yet
warm as Venus.&nbsp; To all others cold<br />As some white glacier glittering
in the sun;<br />To me as ardent as the sensuous rose<br />That yields
its sweetness to the burrowing bee<br />All ignorant of evil in the
world,<br />And innocent as any cloistered nun,<br />Yet wise as Phryne
in the arts of love<br />When I come thirsting to her nectared lips.<br />Good
as the best, and tempting as the worst,<br />A saint, a siren, and a
paradox.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE FIRE BRIGADE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Hark! high o&rsquo;er the rattle and clamour and clatter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
traffic-filled streets, do you hear that loud noise?<br />And pushing
and rushing to see what&rsquo;s the matter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
herds of wild cattle, go pell-mell the boys.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fire in the city! the engines are coming!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
bold bells are clanging, &ldquo;Make way in the street!&rdquo;<br />The
wheels of the hose-cart are spinning and humming<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
time to the music of galloping feet.</p>
<p>Make way there! make way there! the horses are flying,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sparks from their swift hoofs shoot higher and higher,<br />The crowds
are increasing - the gamins are crying:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hooray,
boys!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hooray, boys!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on
to the fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With clanging and banging and clatter and rattle<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
long ladders follow the engine and hose.<br />The men are all ready
to dash into battle;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But will they come out again?&nbsp;
God only knows.</p>
<p>At windows and doorways crowd questioning faces;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s
something about it that quickens one&rsquo;s breath.<br />How proudly
the brave fellows sit in their places -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speed
to the conflict that may be their death!</p>
<p>Still faster and faster and faster and faster<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
grand horses thunder and leap on their way<br />The red foe is yonder,
and may prove the master;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn out there, bold
traffic - turn out there, I say!</p>
<p>For once the loud truckman knows oaths will not matter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
reins in his horses and yields to his fate.<br />The engines are coming!
let pleasure-crowds scatter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let street car and
truckman and mail waggon wait.</p>
<p>They speed like a comet - they pass in a minute;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
boys follow on like a tail to a kite;<br />The commonplace street has
but traffic now in it -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great fire engines
have swept out of sight.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE TIDES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Be careful what rubbish you toss in the tide.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
outgoing billows it drifts from your sight,<br />But back on the incoming
waves it may ride<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And land at your threshold
again before night.<br />Be careful what rubbish you toss in the tide.</p>
<p>Be careful what follies you toss in life&rsquo;s sea.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
bright dancing billows they drift far away,<br />But back on the Nemesis
tides they may be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown down at your threshold
an unwelcome day<br />Be careful what follies you toss in youth&rsquo;s
sea.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<h2>WHEN THE REGIMENT CAME BACK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>All the uniforms were blue, all the swords were bright and new,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the regiment went marching down the street,<br />All the men were hale
and strong as they proudly moved along,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
the cheers that drowned the music of their feet.<br />Oh the music of
the feet keeping time to drums that beat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh
the splendour and the glitter of the sight,<br />As with swords and
rifles new and in uniforms of blue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regiment
went marching to the fight!</p>
<p>When the regiment came back all the guns and swords were black<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the uniforms had faded out to gray,<br />And the faces of the men who
marched through that street again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed like
faces of the dead who lose their way.<br />For the dead who lose their
way cannot look more wan and gray.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh the sorrow
and the pity of the sight,<br />Oh the weary lagging feet out of step
with drums that beat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the regiment comes marching
from the fight.</p>

<h2>WOMAN TO MAN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Woman is man&rsquo;s enemy, rival, and competitor. - JOHN. J. INGALLS.</p>
<p>You do but jest, sir, and you jest not well,<br />How could the hand
be enemy of the arm,<br />Or seed and sod be rivals!&nbsp; How could
light<br />Feel jealousy of heat, plant of the leaf,<br />Or competition
dwell &rsquo;twixt lip and smile?<br />Are we not part and parcel of
yourselves?<br />Like strands in one great braid we entertwine<br />And
make the perfect whole.&nbsp; You could not be,<br />Unless we gave
you birth; we are the soil<br />From which you sprang, yet sterile were
that soil<br />Save as you planted.&nbsp; (Though in the Book we read<br />One
woman bore a child with no man&rsquo;s aid,<br />We find no record of
a man-child born<br />Without the aid of woman!&nbsp; Fatherhood<br />Is
but a small achievement at the best,<br />While motherhood comprises
heaven and hell.)<br />This ever-growing argument of sex<br />Is most
unseemly, and devoid of sense.<br />Why waste more time in controversy,
when<br />There is not time enough for all of love,<br />Our rightful
occupation in this life?<br />Why prate of our defects, of where we
fail,<br />When just the story of our worth would need<br />Eternity
for telling, and our best<br />Development comes ever through your praise,<br />As
through our praise you reach your highest self?<br />Oh! had you not
been miser of your praise<br />And let our virtues be their own reward,<br />The
old-established order of the world<br />Would never have been changed.&nbsp;
Small blame is ours<br />For this unsexing of ourselves, and worse.<br />Effeminising
of the male.&nbsp; We were<br />Content, sir, till you starved us, heart
and brain.<br />All we have done, or wise, or otherwise,<br />Traced
to the root, was done for love of you.<br />Let us taboo all vain comparisons,<br />And
go forth as God meant us, hand in hand,<br />Companions, mates, and
comrades evermore;<br />Two parts of one divinely ordained whole.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE TRAVELLER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Reply to Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;He travels the fastest who
travels alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who travels alone with his eyes on the heights,<br />Though he laughs
in the day time oft weeps in the nights;</p>
<p>For courage goes down at the set of the sun,<br />When the toil of
the journey is all borne by one.</p>
<p>He speeds but to grief though full gaily he ride<br />Who travels
alone without love at his side.</p>
<p>Who travels alone without lover or friend<br />But hurries from nothing,
to naught at the end.</p>
<p>Though great be his winnings and high be his goal,<br />He is bankrupt
in wisdom and beggared in soul.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s one gift of value to him is denied<br />Who travels
alone without love at his side.</p>
<p>It is easy enough in this world to make haste<br />If one live for
that purpose - but think of the waste;</p>
<p>For life is a poem to leisurely read,<br />And the joy of the journey
lies not in its speed.</p>
<p>Oh! vain his achievement and petty his pride<br />Who travels alone
without love at his side.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE EARTH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The earth is yours and mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our God&rsquo;s
bequest.<br />That testament divine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dare
contest?</p>
<p>Usurpers of the earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We claim our share.<br />We
are of royal birth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware! beware!</p>
<p>Unloose the hand of greed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From God&rsquo;s
fair land,<br />We claim but what we need -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That,
we demand.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>NOW</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I leave with God to-morrow&rsquo;s where and how,<br />And do concern
myself but with the Now,<br />That little word, though half the future&rsquo;s
length,<br />Well used, holds twice its meaning and its strength.</p>
<p>Like one blindfolded groping out his way,<br />I will not try to
touch beyond to-day.<br />Since all the future is concealed from sight<br />I
need but strive to make the next step right.</p>
<p>That done, the next, and so on, till I find<br />Perchance some day
I am no longer blind,<br />And looking up, behold a radiant Friend<br />Who
says, &ldquo;Rest, now, for you have reached the end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>YOU AND TO-DAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>With every rising of the sun<br />Think of your life as just begun.</p>
<p>The past has shrived and buried deep<br />All yesterdays - there
let them sleep,</p>
<p>Nor seek to summon back one ghost<br />Of that innumerable host.</p>
<p>Concern yourself with but to-day;<br />Woo it and teach it to obey</p>
<p>Your wish and will.&nbsp; Since time began<br />To-day has been the
friend of man.</p>
<p>But in his blindness and his sorrow<br />He looks to yesterday and
to-morrow.</p>
<p>You and to-day! a soul sublime<br />And the great pregnant hour of
time.</p>
<p>With God between to bind the train,<br />Go forth, I say - attain
- attain.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE REASON</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Do you know what moves the tides<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they swing
from low to high?<br />&rsquo;Tis the love, love, love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the moon within the sky.<br />Oh! they follow where she guides,<br />Do
the faithful-hearted tides.</p>
<p>Do you know what moves the earth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of winter
into spring?<br />&rsquo;Tis the love, love, love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the sun, the mighty king.<br />Oh the rapture that finds birth<br />In
the kiss of sun and earth!</p>
<p>Do you know what makes sweet songs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring for
me above earth&rsquo;s strife?<br />&rsquo;Tis the love, love, love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
you bring into my life,<br />Oh the glory of the songs<br />In the heart
where love belongs!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>MISSION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If you are sighing for a lofty work,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If great
ambitions dominate your mind,<br />Just watch yourself and see you do
not shirk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common little ways of being kind.</p>
<p>If you are dreaming of a future goal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When,
crowned with glory, men shall own your power,<br />Be careful that you
let no struggling soul<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go by unaided in the present
hour.</p>
<p>If you are moved to pity for the earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
long to aid it, do not look so high,<br />You pass some poor, dumb creature
faint with thirst -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All life is equal in the
eternal eye.</p>
<p>If you would help to make the wrong things right,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin
at home: there lies a lifetime&rsquo;s toil.<br />Weed your own garden
fair for all men&rsquo;s sight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you plan
to till another&rsquo;s soil.</p>
<p>God chooses His own leaders in the world,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
from the rest He asks but willing hands.<br />As mighty mountains into
place are hurled,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While patient tides may only
shape the sands.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>REPETITION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Over and over and over<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These truths I will
weave in song -<br />That God&rsquo;s great plan needs you and me,<br />That
will is greater than destiny,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that love moves
the world along.</p>
<p>However mankind may doubt it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall listen
and hear my creed -<br />That God may ever be found within,<br />That
the worship of self is the only sin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the
only devil is greed.</p>
<p>Over and over and over<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These truths I will
say and sing,<br />That love is mightier far than hate,<br />That a
man&rsquo;s own thought is a man&rsquo;s own fate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
that life is a goodly thing.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>BEGIN THE DAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Begin each morning with a talk to God,<br />And ask for your divine
inheritance<br />Of usefulness, contentment, and success.<br />Resign
all fear, all doubt, and all despair.<br />The stars doubt not, and
they are undismayed,<br />Though whirled through space for countless
centuries,<br />And told not why or wherefore: and the sea<br />With
everlasting ebb and flow obeys,<br />And leaves the purpose with the
unseen Cause.<br />The star sheds radiance on a million worlds,<br />The
sea is prodigal with waves, and yet<br />No lustre from the star is
lost, and not<br />One drop is missing from the ocean tides.<br />Oh!
brother to the star and sea, know all<br />God&rsquo;s opulence is held
in trust for those<br />Who wait serenely and who work in faith.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WORDS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Words are great forces in the realm of life:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
careful of their use.&nbsp; Who talks of hate,<br />Of poverty, of sickness,
but sets rife<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These very elements to mar his
fate.</p>
<p>When love, health, happiness, and plenty hear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
names repeated over day by day,<br />They wing their way like answering
fairies near,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then nestle down within our homes
to stay.</p>
<p>Who talks of evil conjures into shape<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
formless thing and gives it life and scope.<br />This is the law: then
let no word escape<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not breathe of everlasting
hope.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>FATE AND I</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Wise men tell me thou, O Fate,<br />Art invincible and great.</p>
<p>Well, I own thy prowess; still<br />Dare I flout thee with my will</p>
<p>Thou canst shatter in a span<br />All the earthly pride of man.</p>
<p>Outward things thou canst control;<br />But stand back - I rule my
soul!</p>
<p>Death?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis such a little thing -<br />Scarcely worth
the mentioning.</p>
<p>What has death to do with me,<br />Save to set my spirit free?</p>
<p>Something in me dwells, O Fate,<br />That can rise and dominate</p>
<p>Loss, and sorrow, and disaster, -<br />How, then, Fate, art thou
my master?</p>
<p>In the great primeval morn<br />My immortal will was born,</p>
<p>Part of that stupendous Cause<br />Which conceived the Solar Laws,</p>
<p>Lit the suns and filled the seas,<br />Royalest of pedigrees.</p>
<p>That great Cause was Love, the Source<br />Who most loves has most
of Force.</p>
<p>He who harbours Hate one hour<br />Saps the soul of Peace and Power.</p>
<p>He who will not hate his foe<br />Need not dread life&rsquo;s hardest
blow.</p>
<p>In the realm of brotherhood<br />Wishing no man aught but good,</p>
<p>Naught but good can come to me -<br />This is Love&rsquo;s supreme
decree.</p>
<p>Since I bar my door to Hate,<br />What have I to fear, O Fate?</p>
<p>Since I fear not - Fate I vow,<br />I the ruler am, not thou!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ATTAINMENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Use all your hidden forces.&nbsp; Do not miss<br />The purpose of
this life, and do not wait<br />For circumstance to mould or change
your fate;<br />In your own self lies Destiny.&nbsp; Let this<br />Vast
truth cast out all fear, all prejudice,<br />All hesitation.&nbsp; Know
that you are great,<br />Great with divinity.&nbsp; So dominate<br />Environment,
and enter into bliss.<br />Love largely and hate nothing.&nbsp; Hold
no aim<br />That does not chord with universal good.<br />Hear what
the voices of the Silence say -<br />All joys are yours if you put forth
your claim.<br />Once let the spiritual laws be understood,<br />Material
things must answer and obey.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A PLEA TO PEACE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When mighty issues loom before us, all<br />The petty great men of
the day seem small,<br />Like pigmies standing in a blaze of light<br />Before
some grim majestic mountain-height.<br />War, with its bloody and impartial
hand,<br />Reveals the hidden weakness of a land,<br />Uncrowns the
heroes trusting Peace has made<br />Of men whose honour is a thing of
trade,<br />And turns the searchlight full on many a place<br />Where
proud conventions long have masked disgrace.<br />O lovely Peace! as
thou art fair be wise.<br />Demand great men, and great men shall arise<br />To
do thy bidding.&nbsp; Even as warriors come,<br />Swift at the call
of bugle and of drum,<br />So at the voice of Peace, imperative<br />As
bugle&rsquo;s call, shall heroes spring to live<br />For country and
for thee.&nbsp; In every land,<br />In every age, men are what times
demand.<br />Demand the best, O Peace, and teach thy sons<br />They
need not rush in front of death-charged guns<br />With murder in their
hearts to prove their worth.<br />The grandest heroes who have graced
the earth<br />Were love-filled souls who did not seek the fray,<br />But
chose the safe, hard, high, and lonely way<br />Of selfless labour for
a suffering world.<br />Beneath our glorious flag again unfurled<br />In
victory such heroes wait to be<br />Called into bloodless action, Peace,
by thee.<br />Be thou insistent in thy stern demand,<br />And wise,
great men shall rise up in the land.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>PRESUMPTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Whenever I am prone to doubt or wonder -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
check myself, and say, &ldquo;That mighty One<br />Who made the solar
system cannot blunder -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the best all
things are being done.&rdquo;<br />Who set the stars on their eternal
courses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has fashioned this strange earth by some
sure plan.<br />Bow low, bow low to those majestic forces,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
dare to doubt their wisdom, puny man.</p>
<p>You cannot put one little star in motion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
cannot shape one single forest leaf,<br />Nor fling a mountain up, nor
sink an ocean,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumptuous pigmy, large with
unbelief.<br />You cannot bring one dawn of regal splendour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
bid the day to shadowy twilight fall,<br />Nor send the pale moon forth
with radiance tender -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dare you doubt the
One who has done all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much is wrong, there is such pain - such sinning.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet
look again - behold how much is right!<br />And He who formed the world
from its beginning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows how to guide it upward
to the light.<br />Your task, O man, is not to carp and cavil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
God&rsquo;s achievements, but with purpose strong<br />To cling to good,
and turn away from evil.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way to help
the world along.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>HIGH NOON</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Time&rsquo;s finger on the dial of my life<br />Points to high noon!
and yet the half-spent day<br />Leaves less than half remaining, for
the dark,<br />Bleak shadows of the grave engulf the end.<br />To those
who burn the candle to the stick,<br />The sputtering socket yields
but little light.<br />Long life is sadder than an early death.<br />We
cannot count on ravelled threads of age<br />Whereof to weave a fabric.&nbsp;
We must use<br />The warp and woof the ready present yields<br />And
toil while daylight lasts.&nbsp; When I bethink<br />How brief the past,
the future, still more brief<br />Calls on to action, action!&nbsp;
Not for me<br />Is time for retrospection or for dreams,<br />Not time
for self-laudation or remorse.<br />Have I done nobly?&nbsp; Then I
must not let<br />Dead yesterday unborn to-morrow shame.<br />Have I
done wrong?&nbsp; Well, let the bitter taste<br />Of fruit that turned
to ashes on my lip<br />Be my reminder in temptation&rsquo;s hour,<br />And
keep me silent when I would condemn.<br />Sometimes it takes the acid
of a sin<br />To cleanse the clouded windows of our souls<br />So pity
may shine through them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back,<br />My faults
and errors seem like stepping-stones<br />That led the way to knowledge
of the truth<br />And made me value virtue; sorrows shine<br />In rainbow
colours o&rsquo;er the gulf of years,<br />Where lie forgotten pleasures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forth,<br />Out to the
western sky still bright with noon,<br />I feel well spurred and booted
for the strife<br />That ends not till Nirvana is attained.</p>
<p>Battling with fate, with men, and with myself,<br />Up the steep
summit of my life&rsquo;s forenoon,<br />Three things I learned, three
things of precious worth,<br />To guide and help me down the western
slope.<br />I have learned how to pray, and toil, and save:<br />To
pray for courage to receive what comes,<br />Knowing what comes to be
divinely sent;<br />To toil for universal good, since thus<br />And
only thus can good come unto me;<br />To save, by giving whatsoe&rsquo;er
I have<br />To those who have not - this alone is gain.</p>

<h2>THOUGHT-MAGNETS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>With each strong thought, with every earnest longing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
aught thou deemest needful to thy soul,<br />Invisible vast forces are
set thronging<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between thee and that goal</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis only when some hidden weakness alters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
changes thy desire, or makes it less,<br />That this mysterious army
ever falters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or stops short of success.</p>
<p>Thought is a magnet; and the longed-for pleasure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
boon, or aim, or object, is the steel;<br />And its attainment hangs
but on the measure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what thy soul can feel.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SMILES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Smile a little, smile a little,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you go
along,<br />Not alone when life is pleasant,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
when things go wrong.<br />Care delights to see you frowning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loves
to hear you sigh;<br />Turn a smiling face upon her -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick
the dame will fly.</p>
<p>Smile a little, smile a little,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along
the road;<br />Every life must have its burden,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every
heart its load.<br />Why sit down in gloom and darkness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
your grief to sup?<br />As you drink Fate&rsquo;s bitter tonic,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile
across the cup.</p>
<p>Smile upon the troubled pilgrims<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom you
pass and meet;<br />Frowns are thorns, and smiles are blossoms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft
for weary feet.<br />Do not make the way seem harder<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
a sullen face;<br />Smile a little, smile a little,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighten
up the place.</p>
<p>Smile upon your undone labour;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for one
who grieves<br />O&rsquo;er his task waits wealth or glory;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
who smiles achieves.<br />Though you meet with loss and sorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the passing years,<br />Smile a little, smile a little,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
through your tears.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Man has explored all countries and all lands,<br />And made his own
the secrets of each clime.<br />Now, ere the world has fully reached
its prime,<br />The oval earth lies compassed with steel bands,<br />The
seas are slaves to ships that touch all strands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
even the haughty elements, sublime<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bold,
yield him their secrets for all time,<br />And speed like lackeys forth
at his commands.</p>
<p>Still, though he search from shore to distant shore,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
no strange realms, no unlocated plains<br />Are left for his attainment
and control,<br />Yet is there one more kingdom to explore.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go,
know thyself, O man! there yet remains<br />The undiscovered country
of thy soul!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE UNIVERSAL ROUTE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As we journey along, with a laugh and a song,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
see, on youth&rsquo;s flower-decked slope,<br />Like a beacon of light,
shining fair on the sight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful Station
of Hope.</p>
<p>But the wheels of old Time roll along as we climb,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
our youth speeds away on the years;<br />And with hearts that are numb
with life&rsquo;s sorrows we come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the mist-covered
Station of Tears.</p>
<p>Still onward we pass, where the milestones, alas!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
the tombs of our dead, to the West,<br />Where glitters and gleams,
in the dying sunbeams,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet, silent Station
of Rest.</p>
<p>All rest is but change, and no grave can estrange<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
soul from its Parent above;<br />And, scorning the rod, it soars back
to its God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the limitless City of Love.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>UNANSWERED PRAYERS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Like some schoolmaster, kind in being stern,<br />Who hears the children
crying o&rsquo;er their slates<br />And calling, &ldquo;Help me, master!&rdquo;
yet helps not,<br />Since in his silence and refusal lies<br />Their
self-development, so God abides<br />Unheeding many prayers.&nbsp; He
is not deaf<br />To any cry sent up from earnest hearts;<br />He hears
and strengthens when He must deny.<br />He sees us weeping over life&rsquo;s
hard sums;<br />But should He give the key and dry our tears,<br />What
would it profit us when school were done<br />And not one lesson mastered?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a world<br />Were this if
all our prayers were answered.&nbsp; Not<br />In famed Pandora&rsquo;s
box were such vast ills<br />As lie in human hearts.&nbsp; Should our
desires,<br />Voiced one by one in prayer, ascend to God<br />And come
back as events shaped to our wish,<br />What chaos would result!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my fierce youth<br />I sighed
out breath enough to move a fleet,<br />Voicing wild prayers to heaven
for fancied boons<br />Which were denied; and that denial bends<br />My
knee to prayers of gratitude each day<br />Of my maturer years.&nbsp;
Yet from those prayers<br />I rose alway regirded for the strife<br />And
conscious of new strength.&nbsp; Pray on, sad heart,<br />That which
thou pleadest for may not be given,<br />But in the lofty altitude where
souls<br />Who supplicate God&rsquo;s grace are lifted, there<br />Thou
shalt find help to bear thy daily lot<br />Which is not elsewhere found.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THANKSGIVING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>We walk on starry fields of white<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not
see the daisies,<br />For blessings common in our sight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
rarely offer praises.<br />We sigh for some supreme delight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
crown our lives with splendour,<br />And quite ignore our daily store<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
pleasures sweet and tender.</p>
<p>Our cares are bold and push their way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
our thought and feeling;<br />They hang about us all the day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
time from pleasure stealing.<br />So unobtrusive many a joy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
pass by and forget it,<br />But worry strives to own our lives,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
conquers if we let it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a day in all the year<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
holds some hidden pleasure,<br />And, looking back, joys oft appear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
brim the past&rsquo;s wide measure.<br />But blessings are like friends,
I hold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who love and labour near us.<br />We
ought to raise our notes of praise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While living
hearts can hear us.</p>
<p>Full many a blessing wears the guise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of worry
or of trouble;<br />Far-seeing is the soul, and wise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who
knows the mask is double.<br />But he who has the faith and strength<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
thank his God for sorrow<br />Has found a joy without alloy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
gladden every morrow.</p>
<p>We ought to make the moments notes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of happy,
glad Thanksgiving;<br />The hours and days a silent phrase<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
music we are living.<br />And so the theme should swell and grow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
weeks and months pass o&rsquo;er us,<br />And rise sublime at this good
time,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grand Thanksgiving chorus.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CONTRASTS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>I see the tall church steeples -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reach
so far, so far;<br />But the eyes of my heart see the world&rsquo;s
great mart<br />Where the starving people are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the church bells ringing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
chimes on the morning air;<br />But my soul&rsquo;s sad ear is hurt
to hear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor man&rsquo;s cry of despair.</p>
<p>Thicker and thicker the churches,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer and
nearer the sky -<br />But alack for their creeds while the poor man&rsquo;s
needs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow deeper as years roll by!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THY SHIP</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Hadst thou a ship, in whose vast hold lay stored<br />The priceless
riches of all climes and lands,<br />Say, wouldst thou let it float
upon the seas<br />Unpiloted, of fickle winds the sport,<br />And of
wild waves and hidden rocks the prey?</p>
<p>Thine is that ship; and in its depths concealed<br />Lies all the
wealth of this vast universe -<br />Yea, lies some part of God&rsquo;s
omnipotence,<br />The legacy divine of every soul.<br />Thy will, O
man, thy will is that great ship,<br />And yet behold it drifting here
and there -<br />One moment lying motionless in port,<br />Then on high
seas by sudden impulse flung,<br />Then drying on the sands, and yet
again<br />Sent forth on idle quests to no-man&rsquo;s land<br />To
carry nothing and to nothing bring;<br />Till, worn and fretted by the
aimless strife<br />And buffeted by vacillating winds,<br />It founders
on a rock, or springs a leak,<br />With all its unused treasures in
the hold.</p>
<p>Go save thy ship, thou sluggard; take the wheel<br />And steer to
knowledge, glory, and success.<br />Great mariners have made the pathway
plain<br />For thee to follow; hold thou to the course<br />Of Concentration
Channel, and all things<br />Shall come in answer to thy swerveless
wish<br />As comes the needle to the magnet&rsquo;s call,<br />Or sunlight
to the prisoned blade of grass<br />That yearns all winter for the kiss
of spring.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LIFE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>All in the dark we grope along,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we
go amiss<br />We learn at least which path is wrong,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
there is gain in this.</p>
<p>We do not always win the race<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By only running
right;<br />We have to tread the mountain&rsquo;s base<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
we reach its height.</p>
<p>The Christs alone no errors made;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So often
had they trod<br />The paths that lead through light and shade,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
had become as God.</p>
<p>As Krishna, Buddha, Christ again,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed
along the way,<br />And left those mighty truths which men<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
dimly grasp to-day.</p>
<p>But he who loves himself the last<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows
the use of pain,<br />Though strewn with errors all his past,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
surely shall attain.</p>
<p>Some souls there are that needs must taste<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
wrong, ere choosing right;<br />We should not call those years a waste<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
led us to the light.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A MARINE ETCHING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A yacht from its harbour ropes pulled free,<br />And leaped like
a steed o&rsquo;er the race-track blue,<br />Then up behind her the
dust of the sea,<br />A gray fog, drifted, and hid her from view.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>&ldquo;LOVE THYSELF LAST&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Love thyself last.&nbsp; Look near, behold thy duty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
those who walk beside thee down life&rsquo;s road.<br />Make glad their
days by little acts of beauty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help them bear
the burden of earth&rsquo;s load.</p>
<p>Love thyself last.&nbsp; Look far and find the stranger<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who
staggers &rsquo;neath his sin and his despair;<br />Go, lend a hand,
and lead him out of danger,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heights where
he may see the world is fair.</p>
<p>Love thyself last.&nbsp; The vastnesses above thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
filled with Spirit-Forces; strong and pure<br />And fervently these
faithful friends shall love thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep thou thy
watch o&rsquo;er others and endure.</p>
<p>Love thyself last, and oh! such joy shall thrill thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
never yet to selfish souls was given;<br />Whate&rsquo;er thy lot, a
perfect peace will fill thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earth shall
seem the ante-room of Heaven.</p>
<p>Love thyself last, and thou shalt grow in spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
see, to hear, to know, and understand.<br />The message of the stars,
lo, thou shalt hear it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all God&rsquo;s joys
shall be at thy command.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHRISTMAS FANCIES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When Christmas bells are swinging above the fields of snow,<br />We
hear sweet voices ringing from lands of long ago,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
etched on vacant places<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are half-forgotten faces<br />Of
friends we used to cherish, and loves we used to know -<br />When Christmas
bells are swinging above the fields of snow.</p>
<p>Uprising from the ocean of the present surging near,<br />We see,
with strange emotion, that is not free from fear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
continent Elysian<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long vanished from our vision,<br />Youth&rsquo;s
lovely lost Atlantis, so mourned for and so dear,<br />Uprising from
the ocean of the present surging near.</p>
<p>When gloomy, gray Decembers are roused to Christmas mirth,<br />The
dullest life remembers there once was joy on earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
draws from youth&rsquo;s recesses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some memory
it possesses,<br />And, gazing through the lens of time, exaggerates
its worth,<br />When gloomy, gray December is roused to Christmas mirth.</p>
<p>When hanging up the holly or mistletoe, I wis<br />Each heart recalls
some folly that lit the world with bliss.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not
all the seers and sages<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wisdom of the ages<br />Can
give the mind such pleasure as memories of that kiss<br />When hanging
up the holly or mistletoe, I wis.</p>
<p>For life was made for loving, and love alone repays,<br />As passing
years are proving, for all of Time&rsquo;s sad ways.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
lies a sting in pleasure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fame gives shallow
measure,<br />And wealth is but a phantom that mocks the restless days,<br />For
life was made for loving, and only loving pays.</p>
<p>When Christmas bells are pelting the air with silver chimes,<br />And
silences are melting to soft, melodious rhymes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
Love, the world&rsquo;s beginning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End fear and
hate and sinning;<br />Let Love, the God Eternal, be worshipped in all
climes<br />When Christmas bells are pelting the air with silver chimes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE RIVER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I am a river flowing from God&rsquo;s sea<br />Through devious ways.&nbsp;
He mapped my course for me;<br />I cannot change it; mine alone the
toil<br />To keep the waters free from grime and soil.<br />The winding
river ends where it began;<br />And when my life has compassed its brief
span<br />I must return to that mysterious source.<br />So let me gather
daily on my course<br />The perfume from the blossoms as I pass,<br />Balm
from the pines, and healing from the grass,<br />And carry down my current
as I go<br />Not common stones but precious gems to show;<br />And tears
(the holy water from sad eyes)<br />Back to God&rsquo;s sea, from which
all rivers rise,<br />Let me convey, not blood from wounded hearts,<br />Nor
poison which the upas tree imparts.<br />When over flowery vales I leap
with joy,<br />Let me not devastate them, nor destroy,<br />But rather
leave them fairer to the sight;<br />Mine be the lot to comfort and
delight.<br />And if down awful chasms I needs must leap,<br />Let me
not murmur at my lot, but sweep<br />On bravely to the end without one
fear,<br />Knowing that He who planned my ways stands near.<br />Love
sent me forth, to Love I go again,<br />For Love is all, and over all.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SORRY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There is much that makes me sorry as I journey down life&rsquo;s
way,<br />And I seem to see more pathos in poor human lives each day.<br />I&rsquo;m
sorry for the strong, brave men who shield the weak from harm,<br />But
who, in their own troubled hours, find no protecting arm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the victors who have reached success, to stand<br />As
targets for the arrows shot by envious failure&rsquo;s hand.<br />I&rsquo;m
sorry for the generous hearts who freely shared their wine,<br />But
drink alone the gall of tears in fortune&rsquo;s drear decline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the souls who build their own fame&rsquo;s funeral
pyre,<br />Derided by the scornful throng like ice deriding fire.<br />I&rsquo;m
sorry for the conquering ones who know not sin&rsquo;s defeat,<br />But
daily tread down fierce desire &rsquo;neath scorched and bleeding feet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the anguished hearts that break with passion&rsquo;s
strain,<br />But I&rsquo;m sorrier for the poor starved souls that never
knew love&rsquo;s pain,<br />Who hunger on through barren years not
tasting joys they crave,<br />For sadder far is such a lot than weeping
o&rsquo;er a grave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the souls that come unwelcomed into birth,<br />I&rsquo;m
sorry for the unloved old who cumber up the earth,<br />I&rsquo;m sorry
for the suffering poor in life&rsquo;s great maelstrom hurled -<br />In
truth, I&rsquo;m sorry for them all who make this aching world.</p>
<p>But underneath whate&rsquo;er seems sad and is not understood,<br />I
know there lies hid from our sight a mighty germ of good.<br />And this
belief stands firm by me, my sermon, motto, text -<br />The sorriest
things in this life will seem grandest in the next.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AMBITION&rsquo;S TRAIL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If all the end of this continuous striving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were
simply <i>to attain</i>,<br />How poor would seem the planning and contriving,<br />The
endless urging and the hurried driving,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of body,
heart, and brain!</p>
<p>But ever in the wake of true achieving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
shines this glowing trail -<br />Some other soul will be spurred on,
conceiving<br />New strength and hope, in its own power believing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
<i>thou</i> didst not fail.</p>
<p>Not thine alone the glory, nor the sorrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
thou dost miss the goal;<br />Undreamed of lives in many a far to-morrow<br />From
thee their weakness or their force shall borrow -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On,
on, ambitious soul.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>UNCONTROLLED</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The mighty forces of mysterious space<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
one by one subdued by lordly man.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awful lightning
that for eons ran<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their devastating and untrammelled
race,<br />Now bear his messages from place to place<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
carrier doves.&nbsp; The winds lead on his van;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
lawless elements no longer can<br />Resist his strength, but yield with
sullen grace.</p>
<p>His bold feet scaling heights before untrod,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light,
darkness, air and water, heat and cold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
bids go forth and bring him power and pelf.<br />And yet, though ruler,
king and demi-god,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks with his fierce passions
uncontrolled,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conqueror
of all things - save himself.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WILL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>You will be what you will to be;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let failure
find its false content<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that poor word &ldquo;environment,&rdquo;<br />But
spirit scorns it, and is free.</p>
<p>It masters time, it conquers space,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cowes
that boastful trickster Chance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bids the
tyrant Circumstance<br />Uncrown and fill a servant&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>The human Will, that force unseen,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offspring
of a deathless Soul,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can hew the way to any goal,<br />Though
walls of granite intervene.</p>
<p>Be not impatient in delay,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wait as one
who understands;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When spirit rises and commands,<br />The
gods are ready to obey.</p>
<p>The river seeking for the sea<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confronts the
dam and precipice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet knows it cannot fail or
miss;<br /><i>You will be what you will to be</i>!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>TO AN ASTROLOGER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Nay, seer, I do not doubt thy mystic lore,<br />Nor question that
the tenor of my life,<br />Past, present, and the future, is revealed<br />There
in my horoscope.&nbsp; I do believe<br />That yon dead moon compels
the haughty seas<br />To ebb and flow, and that my natal star<br />Stands
like a stern-browed sentinel in space<br />And challenges events; nor
lets one grief,<br />Or joy, or failure, or success, pass on<br />To
mar or bless my earthly lot, until<br />It proves its Karmic right to
come to me.</p>
<p>All this I grant, but more than this I <i>know</i>!<br />Before the
solar systems were conceived,<br />When nothing was but the unnamable,<br />My
spirit lived, an atom of the Cause.<br />Through countless ages and
in many forms<br />It has existed, ere it entered in<br />This human
frame to serve its little day<br />Upon the earth.&nbsp; The deathless
Me of me.<br />The spark from that great all-creative fire,<br />Is
part of that eternal source called God,<br />And mightier than the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, he<br />Who knows, and knowing,
never once forgets<br />The pedigree divine of his own soul,<br />Can
conquer, shape, and govern destiny,<br />And use vast space as &rsquo;twere
a board for chess<br />With stars for pawns; can change his horoscope<br />To
suit his will; turn failure to success,<br />And from preordained sorrows,
harvest joy.</p>
<p>There is no puny planet, sun, or moon,<br />Or zodiacal sign which
can control<br />The God in us!&nbsp; If we bring <i>that</i> to bear<br />Upon
events, we mould them to our wish;<br />&rsquo;Tis when the infinite
&rsquo;neath the finite gropes<br />That men are governed by their horoscopes.</p>

<h2>THE TENDRIL&rsquo;S FATE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Under the snow, in the dark and the cold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
pale little sprout was humming;<br />Sweetly it sang, &rsquo;neath the
frozen mould,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beautiful days that were
coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish your songs!&rdquo; said a lump of clay;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What
is there, I ask, to prove them?<br />Just look at the walls between
you and the day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, have you the strength to
move them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But under the ice and under the snow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale
little sprout kept singing,<br />&ldquo;I cannot tell how, but I know,
I know,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what the days are bringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birds, and blossoms, and buzzing bees,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue,
blue skies above me,<br />Bloom on the meadows and buds on the trees<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the great glad sun to love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pebble spoke next: &ldquo;You are quite absurd,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
said, &ldquo;with your song&rsquo;s insistence;<br />For <i>I</i> never
saw a tree or a bird,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So of course there are
none in existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know, I know,&rdquo; the tendril cried,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
beautiful sweet unreason;<br />Till lo! from its prison, glorified,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
burst in the glad spring season.</p>

<h2>THE TIMES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The times are not degenerate.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s
faith<br />Mounts higher than of old.&nbsp; No crumbling creed<br />Can
take from the immortal soul the need<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that
supreme Creator, God.&nbsp; The wraith<br />Of dead beliefs we cherished
in our youth<br />Fades but to let us welcome new-born Truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man may not worship at the ancient shrine<br />Prone
on his face, in self-accusing scorn.<br />That night is past.&nbsp;
He hails a fairer morn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows himself a something
all divine;<br />Not humble worm whose heritage is sin,<br />But, born
of God, he feels the Christ withal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not loud his prayers, as in the olden time,<br />But
deep his reverence for that mighty force,<br />That occult working of
the great All-Source,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes the present
era so sublime.<br />Religion now means something high and broad.<br />And
man stood never half so near to God.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE QUESTION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Beside us in our seeking after pleasures,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
all our restless striving after fame,<br />Through all our search for
worldly gains and treasures,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There walketh one
whom no man likes to name.<br />Silent he follows, veiled of form and
feature,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indifferent if we sorrow or rejoice,<br />Yet
that day comes when every living creature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must
look upon his face and hear his voice.</p>
<p>When that day comes to you, and Death, unmasking,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall
bar your path, and say, &ldquo;Behold the end,&rdquo;<br />What are
the questions that he will be asking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About your
past?&nbsp; Have you considered, friend?<br />I think he will not chide
you for your sinning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor for your creeds or
dogmas will he care;<br />He will but ask, &ldquo;From your life&rsquo;s
first beginning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many burdens have you helped
to bear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SORROW&rsquo;S USES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The uses of sorrow I comprehend<br />Better and better at each year&rsquo;s
end.</p>
<p>Deeper and deeper I seem to see<br />Why and wherefore it has to
be.</p>
<p>Only after the dark, wet days<br />Do we fully rejoice in the sun&rsquo;s
bright rays.</p>
<p>Sweeter the crust tastes after the fast<br />Than the sated gourmand&rsquo;s
finest repast.</p>
<p>The faintest cheer sounds never amiss<br />To the actor who once
has heard a hiss.</p>
<p>To one who the sadness of freedom knows,<br />Light seem the fetters
love may impose.</p>
<p>And he who has dwelt with his heart alone,<br />Hears all the music
in friendship&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>So better and better I comprehend<br />How sorrow ever would be our
friend.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>IF</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&rsquo;Twixt what thou art, and what thou wouldst be, let<br />No
&ldquo;If&rdquo; arise on which to lay the blame.<br />Man makes a mountain
of that puny word,<br />But, like a blade of grass before the scythe,<br />It
falls and withers when a human will,<br />Stirred by creative force,
sweeps toward its aim.</p>
<p>Thou wilt be what thou couldst be.&nbsp; Circumstance<br />Is but
the toy of genius.&nbsp; When a soul<br />Burns with a god-like purpose
to achieve,<br />All obstacles between it and its goal<br />Must vanish
as the dew before the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&rdquo; is the motto of the dilettante<br />And idle dreamer;
&rsquo;tis the poor excuse<br />Of mediocrity.&nbsp; The truly great<br />Know
not the word, or know it but to scorn,<br />Else had Joan of Arc a peasant
died,<br />Uncrowned by glory and by men unsung.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WHICH ARE YOU?</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br /></div>
<p>There are two kinds of people on earth to-day;<br />Just two kinds
of people, no more, I say.</p>
<p>Not the sinner and saint, for it&rsquo;s well understood<br />The
good are half bad, and the bad are half good.</p>
<p>Not the rich and the poor, for to rate a man&rsquo;s wealth<br />You
must first know the state of his conscience and health.</p>
<p>Not the humble and proud, for, in life&rsquo;s little span,<br />Who
puts on vain airs is not counted a man.</p>
<p>Not the happy and sad, for the swift flying years<br />Bring each
man his laughter, and each man his tears.</p>
<p>No; the two kinds of people on earth I mean<br />Are the people who
lift, and the people who lean.</p>
<p>Wherever you go, you will find the earth&rsquo;s masses<br />Are
always divided in just these two classes.</p>
<p>And, oddly enough, you will find too, I ween,<br />There&rsquo;s
only one lifter to twenty who lean.</p>
<p>In which class are you?&nbsp; Are you easing the load<br />Of overtaxed
lifters, who toil down the road?</p>
<p>Or are you a leaner, who lets others share<br />Your portion of labour
and worry and care?</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE CREED TO BE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Our thoughts are moulding unmade spheres,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And,
like a blessing or a curse,<br />They thunder down the formless years,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
ring throughout the universe.</p>
<p>We build our futures by the shape<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our desires,
and not by acts.<br />There is no pathway of escape;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
priest-made creeds can alter facts.</p>
<p>Salvation is not begged or bought;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too long
this selfish hope sufficed;<br />Too long man reeked with lawless thought,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
leaned upon a tortured Christ.</p>
<p>Like shrivelled leaves, these worn-out creeds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
dropping from Religion&rsquo;s tree;<br />The world begins to know its
needs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And souls are crying to be free.</p>
<p>Free from the load of fear and grief,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man
fashioned in an ignorant age;<br />Free from the ache of unbelief<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
fled to in rebellious rage.</p>
<p>No church can bind him to the things<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
fed the first crude souls, evolved;<br />For, mounting up on daring
wings,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He questions mysteries all unsolved.</p>
<p>Above the chant of priests, above<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blatant
voice of braying doubt,<br />He hears the still, small voice of Love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
sends its simple message out.</p>
<p>And clearer, sweeter, day by day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mandate
echoes from the skies,<br />&ldquo;Go roll the stone of self away,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
let the Christ within thee rise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Not like a daring, bold, aggressive boy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
inspiration, eager to pursue,<br />But rather like a maiden, fond, yet
coy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gives herself to him who best doth woo.</p>
<p>Once she may smile, or thrice, thy soul to fire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
passing by, but when she turns her face,<br />Thou must persist and
seek her with desire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou wouldst win the
favour of her grace.</p>
<p>And if, like some winged bird, she cleaves the air,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
leaves thee spent and stricken on the earth,<br />Still must thou strive
to follow even there,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she may know thy valour
and thy worth.</p>
<p>Then shall she come unveiling all her charms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving
thee joy for pain, and smiles for tears;<br />Then shalt thou clasp
her with possessing arms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while she murmurs
music in thine ears.</p>
<p>But ere her kiss has faded from thy cheek,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
shall flee from thee over hill and glade,<br />So must thou seek and
ever seek and seek<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each new conquest of this
phantom maid</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE WISH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Should some great angel say to me to-morrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thou
must re-tread thy pathway from the start,<br />But God will grant, in
pity, for thy sorrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one dear wish, the
nearest to thy heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This were my wish! - from my life&rsquo;s dim beginning<br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
be what has been</i>! wisdom planned the whole<br />My want, my woe,
my errors, and my sinning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All, all were needed
lessons for my soul.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THREE FRIENDS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Of all the blessings which my life has known,<br />I value most,
and most praise God for three:<br />Want, Loneliness, and Pain, those
comrades true,</p>
<p>Who masqueraded in the garb of foes<br />For many a year, and filled
my heart with dread.<br />Yet fickle joys, like false, pretentious friends,<br />Have
proved less worthy than this trio.&nbsp; First,</p>
<p>Want taught me labour, led me up the steep<br />And toilsome paths
to hills of pure delight,<br />Trod only by the feet that know fatigue,<br />And
yet press on until the heights appear.</p>
<p>Then loneliness and hunger of the heart<br />Sent me upreaching to
the realms of space,<br />Till all the silences grew eloquent,<br />And
all their loving forces hailed me friend.</p>
<p>Last, pain taught prayer! placed in my hand the staff<br />Of close
communion with the over-soul,<br />That I might lean upon it to the
end,<br />And find myself made strong for any strife.</p>
<p>And then these three who had pursued my steps<br />Like stern, relentless
foes, year after year,<br />Unmasked, and turned their faces full on
me,<br />And lo! they were divinely beautiful,<br />For through them
shone the lustrous eyes of Love.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>YOU NEVER CAN TELL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>You never can tell when you send a word,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
an arrow shot from a bow<br />By an archer blind, be it cruel or kind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just
where it may chance to go!<br />It may pierce the breast of your dearest
friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tipped with its poison or balm;<br />To
a stranger&rsquo;s heart in life&rsquo;s great mart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
may carry its pain or its calm.</p>
<p>You never can tell when you do an act<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just
what the result will be;<br />But with every deed you are sowing a seed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
the harvest you may not see.<br />Each kindly act is an acorn dropped<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
God&rsquo;s productive soil.<br />You may not know, but the tree shall
grow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With shelter for those who toil.</p>
<p>You never can tell what your thoughts will do,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
bringing you hate or love;<br />For thoughts are things, and their airy
wings<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are swifter than carrier doves.<br />They
follow the law of the universe -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each thing must
create its kind;<br />And they speed o&rsquo;er the track to bring you
back<br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever went out from your mind.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>HERE AND NOW</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Here, in the heart of the world,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in
the noise and the din,<br />Here, where our spirits were hurled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
battle with sorrow and sin,<br />This is the place and the spot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
knowledge of infinite things<br />This is the kingdom where Thought<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can
conquer the prowess of kings</p>
<p>Wait for no heavenly life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek for no temple
alone;<br />Here, in the midst of the strife,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know
what the sages have known.<br />See what the Perfect Ones saw -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
in the depth of each soul,<br />God as the light and the law,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
as beginning and goal.</p>
<p>Earth is one chamber of Heaven,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is no
grander than birth.<br />Joy in the life that was given,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strive
for perfection on earth;<br />Here, in the turmoil and roar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show
what it is to be calm;<br />Show how the spirit can soar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
bring hack its healing and balm.</p>
<p>Stand not aloof nor apart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunge in the thick
of the fight;<br />There, in the street and the mart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
is the place to do right.<br />Not in some cloister or cave,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not
in some kingdom above,<br />Here, on this side of the grave,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here,
should we labour and love.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>UNCONQUERED</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>However skilled and strong art thou, my foe,<br />However fierce
is thy relentless hate,<br />Though firm thy hand, and strong thy aim,
and straight<br />Thy poisoned arrow leaves the bended bow,</p>
<p>To pierce the target of my heart, ah! know<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
am the master yet of my own fate.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst
not rob me of my best estate,<br />Though fortune, fame, and friends,
yea, love shall go.</p>
<p>Not to the dust shall my true self be hurled,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor
shall I meet thy worst assaults dismayed;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
all things in the balance are well weighed,<br />There is but one great
danger in the world -<br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not force
my soul to wish thee ill</i>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the only
evil that can kill.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>ALL THAT LOVE ASKS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All that I ask,&rdquo; says Love, &ldquo;is
just to stand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gaze, unchided, deep in thy
dear eyes;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For in their depths lies largest Paradise.<br />Yet,
if perchance one pressure of thy hand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be granted
me, then joy I thought complete<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were
still more sweet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All that I ask,&rdquo; says Love, &ldquo;all
that I ask,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is just thy hand-clasp.&nbsp; Could
I brush thy cheek<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As zephyrs brush a rose leaf,
words are weak<br />To tell the bliss in which my soul would bask.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is no language but would desecrate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
joy so great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All that I ask, is just one tender touch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
that soft cheek.&nbsp; Thy pulsing palm in mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy
dark eyes lifted in a trust divine,<br />And those curled lips that
tempt me overmuch<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned where I may not seize
the supreme bliss<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one mad
kiss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All that I ask,&rdquo; says Love, &ldquo;of
life, of death,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of high heaven itself, is
just to stand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glance melting into glance, hand
twined in hand,<br />The while I drink the nectar of thy breath<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
one sweet kiss, but one, of all thy store,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
ask no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All that I ask&rdquo; - nay, self-deceiving
Love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse thy phrase, so thus the words may
fall,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In place of &ldquo;all I ask,&rdquo; say,
&ldquo;I ask all,&rdquo;<br />All that pertains to earth or soars above,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
that thou wert, art, will be, body, soul,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
asks the whole,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>&ldquo;DOES IT PAY?&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If one poor burdened toiler o&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s road,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who
meets us by the way,<br />Goes on less conscious of his galling load,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
life, indeed, does pay.</p>
<p>If we can show one troubled heart the gain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
lies alway in loss,<br />Why, then, we too are paid for all the pain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
bearing life&rsquo;s hard cross.</p>
<p>If some despondent soul to hope is stirred,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
sad lip made to smile,<br />By any act of ours, or any word,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then,
life has been worth while.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SESTINA</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I wandered o&rsquo;er the vast green plains of youth,<br />And searched
for Pleasure.&nbsp; On a distant height<br />Fame&rsquo;s silhouette
stood sharp against the skies.<br />Beyond vast crowds that thronged
a broad highway<br />I caught the glimmer of a golden goal,<br />While
from a blooming bower smiled siren Love.</p>
<p>Straight gazing in her eyes, I laughed at Love<br />With all the
haughty insolence of youth,<br />As past her bower I strode to seek
my goal.<br />&ldquo;Now will I climb to glory&rsquo;s dizzy height,&rdquo;<br />I
said, &ldquo;for there above the common way<br />Doth pleasure dwell
companioned by the skies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when I reached that summit near the skies,<br />So far from man
I seemed, so far from Love -<br />&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;doth
Pleasure find her way.&rdquo;<br />Seen from the distant borderland
of youth,<br />Fame smiles upon us from her sun-kissed height,<br />But
frowns in shadows when we reach the goal.</p>
<p>Then were mine eyes fixed on that glittering goal,<br />Dear to all
sense - sunk souls beneath the skies.<br />Gold tempts the artist from
the lofty height,<br />Gold lures the maiden from the arms of Love,<br />Gold
buys the fresh, ingenuous heart of youth,<br />&ldquo;And gold,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;will show me Pleasure&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But ah! the soil and discord of that way,<br />Where savage hordes
rushed headlong to the goal,<br />Dead to the best impulses of their
youth,<br />Blind to the azure beauty of the skies;<br />Dulled to the
voice of conscience and of love,<br />They wandered far from Truth&rsquo;s
eternal height.</p>
<p>Then Truth spoke to me from that noble height,<br />Saying, &ldquo;Thou
didst pass Pleasure on the way,<br />She with the yearning eyes so full
of Love,<br />Whom thou disdained to seek for glory&rsquo;s goal.<br />Two
blending paths beneath God&rsquo;s arching skies<br />Lead straight
to Pleasure.&nbsp; Ah! blind heart of youth,<br />Not up fame&rsquo;s
height, not toward the base god&rsquo;s goal,<br />Doth Pleasure make
her way, but &rsquo;neath calm skies<br />Where Duty walks with Love
in endless youth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE OPTIMIST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The fields were bleak and sodden.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a wing<br />Or
note enlivened the depressing wood;<br />A soiled and sullen, stubborn
snowdrift stood<br />Beside the roadway.&nbsp; Winds came muttering<br />Of
storms to be, and brought the chilly sting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
icebergs in their breath.&nbsp; Stalled cattle mooed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth
plaintive pleadings for the earth&rsquo;s green food.<br />No gleam,
no hint of hope in anything.</p>
<p>The sky was blank and ashen, like the face<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
some poor wretch who drains life&rsquo;s cup too fast<br />Yet, swaying
to and fro, as if to fling<br />About chilled Nature its lithe arms
of grace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling with promise in the wintry
blast,<br />The optimistic Willow spoke of spring.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THE PESSIMIST</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The pessimistic locust, last to leaf,<br />Though all the world is
glad, still talks of grief.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>AN INSPIRATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>However the battle is ended,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though proudly
the victor comes<br />With fluttering flags and prancing nags<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
echoing roll of drums,<br />Still truth proclaims this motto<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
letters of living light, -<br />No question is ever settled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
it is settled right.</p>
<p>Though the heel of the strong oppressor<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May
grind the weak in the dust;<br />And the voices of fame with one acclaim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May
call him great and just,<br />Let those who applaud take warning.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
keep this motto in sight, -<br />No question is ever settled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
it is settled right.</p>
<p>Let those who have failed take courage;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
the enemy seems to have won,<br />Though his ranks are strong, if he
be in the wrong<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is not yet done;<br />For,
sure as the morning follows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkest hour
of the night,<br />No question is ever settled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
it is settled right.</p>
<p>O man bowed down with labour!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O woman young,
yet old!<br />O heart oppressed in the toiler&rsquo;s breast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
crushed by the power of gold<br />Keep on with your weary battle<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against
triumphant might;<br />No question is ever settled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
it is settled right.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LIFE&rsquo;S HARMONIES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Let no man pray that he know not sorrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
no soul ask to be free from pain,<br />For the gall of to-day is the
sweet of to-morrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moment&rsquo;s loss
is the lifetime&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<p>Through want of a thing does its worth redouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
hunger&rsquo;s pangs does the feast content,<br />And only the heart
that has harboured trouble<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can fully rejoice
when joy is sent.</p>
<p>Let no man shrink from the bitter tonics<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
grief, and yearning, and need, and strife,<br />For the rarest chords
in the soul&rsquo;s harmonics<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are found in the
minor strains of life.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>PREPARATION</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>We must not force events, but rather make<br />The heart soil ready
for their coming, as<br />The earth spreads carpets for the feet of
Spring,<br />Or, with the strengthening tonic of the frost,<br />Prepares
for winter.&nbsp; Should a July noon<br />Burst suddenly upon a frozen
world<br />Small joy would follow, even though that world<br />Were
longing for the Summer.&nbsp; Should the sting<br />Of sharp December
pierce the heart of June,<br />What death and devastation would ensue!<br />All
things are planned.&nbsp; The most majestic sphere<br />That whirls
through space is governed and controlled<br />By supreme law, as is
the blade of grass<br />Which through the bursting bosom of the earth<br />Creeps
up to kiss the light.&nbsp; Poor, puny man<br />Alone doth strive and
battle with the Force<br />Which rules all lives and worlds, and he
alone<br />Demands effect before producing cause.<br />How vain the
hope!&nbsp; We cannot harvest joy<br />Until we sow the seed, and God
alone<br />Knows when that seed has ripened.&nbsp; Oft we stand<br />And
watch the ground with anxious, brooding eyes,<br />Complaining of the
slow, unfruitful yield,<br />Not knowing that the shadow of ourselves<br />Keeps
off the sunlight and delays result.<br />Sometimes our fierce impatience
of desire<br />Doth like a sultry May force tender shoots<br />Of half-formed
pleasures and unshaped events<br />To ripen prematurely, and we reap<br />But
disappointment; or we rot the germs<br />With briny tears ere they have
time to grow.<br />While stars are born and mighty planets die<br />And
hissing comets scorch the brow of space,<br />The Universe keeps its
eternal calm.<br />Through patient preparation, year on year,<br />The
earth endures the travail of the Spring<br />And Winter&rsquo;s desolation.&nbsp;
So our souls<br />In grand submission to a higher law<br />Should move
serene through all the ills of life<br />Believing them masked joys.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>GETHSEMANE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In golden youth when seems the earth<br />A Summer-land of singing
mirth,<br />When souls are glad and hearts are light,<br />And not a
shadow lurks in sight,<br />We do not know it, but there lieu<br />Somewhere
veiled under evening skies<br />A garden which we all must see -<br />The
garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p>With joyous steps we go our ways,<br />Love lends a halo to our days;<br />Light
sorrows sail like clouds afar,<br />We laugh, and say how strong we
are.<br />We hurry on; and hurrying, go<br />Close to the borderland
of woe<br />That waits for you, and waits for me -<br />Forever waits
Gethsemane.</p>
<p>Down shadowy lanes, across strange streams,<br />Bridged over by
our broken dreams;<br />Behind the misty caps of years,<br />Beyond
the great salt fount of tears,<br />The garden lies.&nbsp; Strive as
you may,<br />You cannot miss it in your way;<br />All paths that have
been, or shall be,<br />Pass somewhere through Gethsemane.</p>
<p>All those who journey, soon or late,<br />Must pass within the garden&rsquo;s
gate;<br />Must kneel alone in darkness there,<br />And battle with
some fierce despair.<br />God pity those who cannot say,<br />&ldquo;Not
mine but Thine&rdquo;; who only pray<br />&ldquo;Let this cup pass,&rdquo;
and cannot see<br />The <i>purpose</i> in Gethsemane.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>GOD&rsquo;S MEASURE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>God measures souls by their capacity<br />For entertaining his best
Angel, Love.<br />Who loveth most is nearest kin to God,<br />Who is
all Love, or Nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who sits<br />And looks out
on the palpitating world,<br />And feels his heart swell in him large
enough<br />To hold all men within it, he is near<br />His great Creator&rsquo;s
standard, though he dwells<br />Outside the pale of churches, and knows
not<br />A feast-day from a fast-day, or a line<br />Of Scripture even.&nbsp;
What God wants of us<br />Is that outreaching bigness that ignores<br />All
littleness of aims, or loves, or creeds,<br />And clasps all Earth and
Heaven in its embrace.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>NOBLESSE OBLIGE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I hold it the duty of one who is gifted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
specially dowered in all men&rsquo;s sight,<br />To know no rest till
his life is lifted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully up to his great gifts&rsquo;
height.</p>
<p>He must mould the man into rare completeness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
gems are set only in gold refined.<br />He must fashion his thoughts
into perfect sweetness.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast out folly and
pride from his mind.</p>
<p>For he who drinks from a god&rsquo;s gold fountain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
art or music or rhythmic song<br />Must sift from his soul the chaff
of malice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weed from his heart the roots
of wrong.</p>
<p>Great gifts should be worn, like a crown befitting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
not like gems in a beggar&rsquo;s hands!<br />And the toil must be constant
and unremitting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which lifts up the king to the
crown&rsquo;s demands.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>THROUGH TEARS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>An artist toiled over his pictures;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laboured
by night and by day,<br />He struggled for glory and honour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
the world, it had nothing to say.<br />His walls were ablaze with the
splendours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see in the beautiful skies;<br />But
the world beheld only the colours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That were made
out of chemical dyes.</p>
<p>Time sped.&nbsp; And he lived, loved, and suffered;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
passed through the valley of grief.<br />Again he toiled over his canvas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
in labour alone was relief.<br />It showed not the splendour of colours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
those of his earlier years;<br />But the world? the world bowed down
before it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was painted with tears.</p>
<p>A poet was gifted with genius,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sang,
and he sang all the days.<br />He wrote for the praise of the people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
the people accorded no praise.<br />Oh! his songs were as blithe as
the morning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sweet as the music of birds;<br />But
the world had no homage to offer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they
were nothing but words.</p>
<p>Time sped.&nbsp; And the poet through sorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became
like his suffering kind.<br />Again he toiled over his poems<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
lighten the grief of his mind.<br />They were not so flowing and rhythmic<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
those of his earlier years;<br />But the world? lo! it offered its homage,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
they were written in tears.</p>
<p>So ever the price must be given<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those seeking
glory in art;<br />So ever the world is repaying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
grief-stricken, suffering heart.<br />The happy must ever be humble;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition
must wait for the years<br />Ere hoping to win the approval<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
a world that looks on through its tears.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>What does our country need?&nbsp; No armies standing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
sabres gleaming ready for the fight;<br />Not increased navies, skilful
and commanding,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bound the waters with an iron
might;<br />Not haughty men with glutted purses trying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
purchase souls, and keep the power of place;<br />Not jewelled dolls
with one another vying<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For palms of beauty, elegance,
and grace.</p>
<p>But we want women, strong of soul, yet lowly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
that rare meekness, born of gentleness;<br />Women whose lives are pure
and clean and holy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women whom all little
children bless;<br />Brave, earnest women, helpful to each other,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
finest scorn for all things low and mean;<br />Women who hold the names
of wife and mother<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far nobler than the title
of a queen.</p>
<p>Oh! these are they who mould the men of story,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
mothers, ofttimes shorn of grace and youth,<br />Who, worn and weary,
ask no greater glory<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than making some young soul
the home of truth;<br />Who sow in hearts all fallow for the sowing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
seeds of virtue and of scorn for sin,<br />And, patient, watch the beauteous
harvest growing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weed out tares which crafty
hands cast in;</p>
<p>Women who do not hold the gift of beauty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
some rare treasure to be bought and sold.<br />But guard it as a precious
aid to duty -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer framing of the inner
gold;<br />Women who, low above their cradles bending,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
flattery&rsquo;s voice go by, and give no heed,<br />While their pure
prayers like incense are ascending<br /><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These</i>
are our country&rsquo;s pride, our country&rsquo;s need,</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>PLEA TO SCIENCE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>O Science, reaching backward through the distance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
earnest child of God,<br />Exposing all the secrets of existence,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
thy divining rod,<br />I bid thee speed up to the heights supernal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear
thinker, ne&rsquo;er sufficed;<br />Go seek and bind the laws and truths
eternal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But leave me Christ.</p>
<p>Upon the vanity of pious sages<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let in the
light of day;<br />Break down the superstitions of all ages -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust
bigotry away;<br />Stride on, and bid all stubborn foes defiance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
Truth and Reason reign:<br />But I beseech thee, O Immortal Science,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let
Christ remain.</p>
<p>What canst thou give to help me bear my crosses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
place of Him, my Lord?<br />And what to recompense for all my losses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
bring me sweet reward?<br /><i>Thou</i> couldst not with thy clear,
cold eyes of reason,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou couldst not comfort
me<br />Like One who passed through that tear-blotted season<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
sad Gethsemane!</p>
<p>Through all the weary, wearing hour of sorrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
word that thou hast said<br />Would make me strong to wait for some
to-morrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I should find my dead?<br />When
I am weak, and desolate, and lonely -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prone
to follow wrong?<br />Not thou, O Science - Christ, my Saviour, only<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can
make me strong.</p>
<p>Thou art so cold, so lofty, and so distant,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
great my need might be,<br />No prayer, however constant and persistent,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could
bring thee down to me.<br />Christ stands so near, to help me through
each hour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To guide me day by day<br />O Science,
sweeping all before thy power -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Christ,
I pray!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>RESPITE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The mighty conflict, which we call existence,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth
wear upon the body and the soul,<br />Our vital forces wasted in resistance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
much there is to conquer and control.</p>
<p>The rock which meets the billows with defiance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undaunted
and unshaken day by day,<br />In spite of its unyielding self-reliance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
by the warfare surely worn away.</p>
<p>And there are depths and heights of strong emotions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
surge at times within the human breast,<br />More fierce than all the
tides of all the oceans<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sweep on ever in
divine unrest.</p>
<p>I sometimes think the rock worn with adventures,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
sad with thoughts of conflicts yet to be,<br />Must envy the frail reed
which no one censures,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, overcome, &rsquo;tis
swallowed by the sea.</p>
<p>This life is all resistance and repression.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear
God, if in that other world unseen,<br />Not rest we find, but new life
and progression,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant us a respite in the grave
between.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>SONG</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>O praise me not with your lips, dear one!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
your tender words I prize.<br />But dearer by far is the soulful gaze<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
your eyes, your beautiful eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
tender, loving eyes.</p>
<p>O chide me not with your lips, dear one!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
I cause your bosom sighs.<br />You can make repentance deeper far<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
your sad, reproving eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
sorrowful, troubled eyes.</p>
<p>Words, at the best, are but hollow sounds;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above,
in the beaming skies,<br />The constant stars say never a word,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
only smile with their eyes -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile
on with their lustrous eyes.</p>
<p>Then breathe no vow with your lips, dear one;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the winged wind speech flies.<br />But I read the truth of your noble
heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your soulful, speaking eyes -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
your deep and beautiful eyes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>MY SHIPS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If all the ships I have at sea<br />Should come a-sailing home to
me,<br />Ah, well! the harbour could not hold<br />So many sails as
there would be<br />If all my ships came in from sea.</p>
<p>If half my ships came home from sea,<br />And brought their precious
freight to me,<br />Ah, well!&nbsp; I should have wealth as great<br />As
any king who sits in state -<br />So rich the treasures that would be<br />In
half my ships now out at sea.</p>
<p>If just one ship I have at sea<br />Should come a-sailing home to
me,<br />Ah, well! the storm-clouds then might frown<br />For if the
others all went down,<br />Still rich and proud and glad I&rsquo;d be<br />If
that one ship came back to me.</p>
<p>If that one ship went down at sea,<br />And all the others came to
me,<br />Weighed down with gems and wealth untold,<br />With glory,
honours, riches, gold,<br />The poorest soul on earth I&rsquo;d be<br />If
that one ship came not to me.</p>
<p>O skies, be calm!&nbsp; O winds, blow free -<br />Blow all my ships
safe home to me!<br />But if thou sendest some a-wrack,<br />To never
more come sailing back,<br />Send any - all that skim the sea,<br />But
bring my love-ship home to me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>HER LOVE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The sands upon the ocean side<br />That change about with every tide,<br />And
never true to one abide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman&rsquo;s love
I liken to.</p>
<p>The summer zephyrs, light and vain,<br />That sing the same alluring
strain<br />To every grass blade on the plain -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
woman&rsquo;s love is nothing more.</p>
<p>The sunshine of an April day<br />That comes to warm you with its
ray,<br />But while you smile has flown away -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
woman&rsquo;s love is like to this.</p>
<p>God made poor woman with no heart,<br />But gave her skill, and tact,
and art,<br />And so she lives, and plays her part.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
must not blame, but pity her.</p>
<p>She leans to man - but just to hear<br />The praise he whispers in
her ear;<br />Herself, not him, she holdeth dear -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O
fool! to be deceived by her.</p>
<p>To sate her selfish thirst she quaffs<br />The love of strong hearts
in sweet draughts,<br />Then throws them lightly by and laughs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too
weak to understand their pain.</p>
<p>As changeful as the winds that blow<br />From every region to and
fro,<br />Devoid of heart, she cannot know<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
suffering of a human heart.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>IF</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Dear love, if you and I could sail away,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
snowy pennons to the winds unfurled,<br />Across the waters of some
unknown bay,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find some island far from all
the world;</p>
<p>If we could dwell there, evermore alone,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
unrecorded years slip by apace,<br />Forgetting and forgotten and unknown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
aught save native song-birds of the place;</p>
<p>If Winter never visited that land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Summer&rsquo;s
lap spilled o&rsquo;er with fruits and flowers,<br />And tropic trees
cast shade on every hand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twin&egrave;d boughs
formed sleep-inviting bowers;</p>
<p>If from the fashions of the world set free,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
hid away from all its jealous strife,<br />I lived alone for you, and
you for me -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! then, dear love, how sweet were
wedded life.</p>
<p>But since we dwell here in the crowded way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
hurrying throngs rush by to seek for gold,<br />And all is commonplace
and work-a-day<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as love&rsquo;s young
honeymoon grows old;</p>
<p>Since fashion rules and nature yields to art,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
life is hurt by daily jar and fret,<br />&rsquo;Tis best to shut such
dreams down in the heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go our ways alone,
love, and forget.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LOVE&rsquo;S BURIAL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Let us clear a little space,<br />And make Love a burial-place.</p>
<p>He is dead, dear, as you see,<br />And he wearies you and me.</p>
<p>Growing heavier, day by day,<br />Let us bury him, I say.</p>
<p>Wings of dead white butterflies,<br />These shall shroud him, as
he lies</p>
<p>In his casket rich and rare,<br />Made of finest maiden-hair.</p>
<p>With the pollen of the rose<br />Let us his white eyelids close.</p>
<p>Put the rose thorn in his hand,<br />Shorn of leaves - you understand.</p>
<p>Let some holy water fall<br />On his dead face, tears of gall -</p>
<p>As we kneel to him and say,<br />&ldquo;Dreams to dreams,&rdquo;
and turn away.</p>
<p>Those gravediggers, Doubt, Distrust,<br />They will lower him to
the dust.</p>
<p>Let us part here with a kiss -<br />You go that way, I go this.</p>
<p>Since we buried Love to-day<br />We will walk a separate way.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<h2>&ldquo;LOVE IS ENOUGH&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Love is enough.&nbsp; Let us not ask for gold.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wealth
breeds false aims, and pride, and selfishness;<br />In those serene,
Arcadian days of old<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men gave no thought to princely
homes and dress.<br />The gods who dwelt on fair Olympia&rsquo;s height<br />Lived
only for dear love and love&rsquo;s delight.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
is enough.</p>
<p>Love is enough.&nbsp; Why should we care for fame?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition
is a most unpleasant guest:<br />It lures us with the glory of a name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far
from the happy haunts of peace and rest.<br />Let us stay here in this
secluded place<br />Made beautiful by love&rsquo;s endearing grace!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
is enough.</p>
<p>Love is enough.&nbsp; Why should we strive for power?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
brings men only envy and distrust.<br />The poor world&rsquo;s homage
pleases but an hour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earthly honours vanish
in the dust.<br />The grandest lives are ofttimes desolate;<br />Let
me be loved, and let who will be great.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
is enough.</p>
<p>Love is enough.&nbsp; Why should we ask for more?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
greater gift have gods vouchsafed to men?<br />What better boon of all
their precious store<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than our fond hearts that
love and love again?<br />Old love may die; new love is just as sweet;<br />And
life is fair and all the world complete:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
is enough!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>LIFE IS A PRIVILEGE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Life is a privilege.&nbsp; Its youthful days<br />Shine with the
radiance of continuous Mays.<br />To live, to breathe, to wonder and
desire,<br />To feed with dreams the heart&rsquo;s perpetual fire,<br />To
thrill with virtuous passions, and to glow<br />With great ambitions
- in one hour to know<br />The depths and heights of feeling - God!
in truth,<br />How beautiful, how beautiful is youth!</p>
<p>Life is a privilege.&nbsp; Like some rare rose<br />The mysteries
of the human mind unclose.<br />What marvels lie in earth, and air,
and sea!<br />What stores of knowledge wait our opening key!<br />What
sunny roads of happiness lead out<br />Beyond the realms of indolence
and doubt!<br />And what large pleasures smile upon and bless<br />The
busy avenues of usefulness!</p>
<p>Life is a privilege.&nbsp; Though noontide fades<br />And shadows
fall along the winding glades,<br />Though joy-blooms wither in the
autumn air,<br />Yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there.<br />Pale
sorrow leads us closer to our kind,<br />And in the serious hours of
life we find<br />Depths in the souls of men which lend new worth<br />And
majesty to this brief span of earth.</p>
<p>Life is a privilege.&nbsp; If some sad fate<br />Sends us alone to
seek the exit gate,<br />If men forsake us and as shadows fall,<br />Still
does the supreme privilege of all<br />Come in that reaching upward
of the soul<br />To find the welcoming Presence at the goal,<br />And
in the Knowledge that our feet have trod<br />Paths that led from, and
must wind back, to God.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>INSIGHT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Sirs, when you pity us, I say<br />You waste your pity.&nbsp; Let
it stay,<br />Well corked and stored upon your shelves,<br />Until you
need it for yourselves.</p>
<p>We do appreciate God&rsquo;s thought<br />In forming you, before
He brought<br />Us into life.&nbsp; His art was crude,<br />But oh!
so virile in its rude,</p>
<p>Large, elemental strength; and then<br />He learned His trade in
making men,<br />Learned how to mix and mould the clay<br />And fashion
in a finer way.</p>
<p>How fine that skilful way can be<br />You need but lift your eyes
to see;<br />And we are glad God placed you there<br />To lift your
eyes and find us fair.</p>
<p>Apprentice labour though you were,<br />He made you great enough
to stir<br />The best and deepest depths of us,<br />And we are glad
He made you thus.</p>
<p>Aye! we are glad of many things;<br />God strung our hearts with
such fine strings<br />The least breath moves them, and we hear<br />Music
where silence greets your ear.</p>
<p>We suffer so?&nbsp; But women&rsquo;s souls,<br />Like violet-powder
dropped on coals,<br />Give forth their best in anguish.&nbsp; Oh<br />The
subtle secrets that we know</p>
<p>Of joy in sorrow, strange delights<br />Of ecstasy in pain-filled
nights,<br />And mysteries of gain in loss<br />Known but to Christ
upon the cross!</p>
<p>Our tears are pitiful to you?<br />Look how the heaven-reflecting
dew<br />Dissolves its life in tears.&nbsp; The sand<br />Meanwhile
lies hard upon the strand.</p>
<p>How could your pity find a place<br />For us, the mothers of the
race?<br />Men may be fathers unaware,<br />So poor the title is you
wear.</p>
<p>But mothers - who that crown adorns<br />Knows all its mingled blooms
and thorns,<br />And she whose feet that pain hath trod<br />Hath walked
upon the heights with God.</p>
<p>No, offer us not pity&rsquo;s cup.<br />There is no looking down
or up<br />Between us; eye looks straight in eye:<br />Born equals,
so we live and die.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>A WOMAN&rsquo;S ANSWER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>You call me an angel of love and of light,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
being of goodness and heavenly fire,<br />Sent out from God&rsquo;s
kingdom to guide you aright,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paths where your
spirit may mount and aspire,<br />You say that I glow like a star on
its course,<br />Like a ray from the altar, a spark from the source.</p>
<p>Now list to my answer - let all the world hear it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
speak unafraid what I know to be true -<br />A pure, faithful love is
the creative spirit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which make women angels!&nbsp;
I live but in you.<br />We are bound soul to soul by life&rsquo;s holiest
laws;<br />If I am an angel - why, you are the cause.</p>
<p>As my ship skims the sea, I look up from the deck.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair,
firm at the wheel shines Love&rsquo;s beautiful form.<br />And shall
I curse the bark that last night went to wreck<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
the pilot abandoned to darkness and storm?<br />My craft is no stauncher,
she too had been lost<br />Had the wheelman deserted, or slept at his
post.</p>
<p>I laid down the wealth of my soul at your feet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some
woman does this for some man every day).<br />No desperate creature
who walks in the street<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has a wickeder heart
than I might have, I say,<br />Had you wantonly misused the treasures
you won -<br />As so many men with heart-riches have done.</p>
<p>This fire from God&rsquo;s altar, this holy love-flame,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
burns like sweet incense forever for you,<br />Might now be a wild conflagration
of shame,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you tortured my heart, or been
base or untrue.<br />For angels and devils are cast in one mould,<br />Till
love guides them upward or downward, I hold.</p>
<p>I tell you the women who make fervent wives<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
sweet tender mothers, had Fate been less fair,<br />Are the women who
might have abandoned their lives<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the madness
that springs from and ends in despair.<br />As the fire on the hearth
which sheds brightness around,<br />Neglected, may level the walls to

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
