Where the Queen goes forth and never comes back.</p>

Shall the Flags of all Nations be half-mast-furled,<br />

Who is riding away from the Courts of earth,<br />
Riding away from the world&rsquo;s unrest<br />
To a mystical goal, on a secret quest.</p>

And crowned with the love she has left behind<br />
In the hidden depths of each mourner&rsquo;s mind.</p>

MEETING OF THE CENTURIES</h2>
<p class="poetry">A curious vision on mine eyes unfurled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the deep night.&nbsp; I saw, or seemed to see,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Centuries meet, and sit down vis-&agrave;-vis<br
/>
Across the great round table of the world:<br />
One with suggested sorrows in his mien,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on his brow the furrowed lines of thought;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one whose glad expectant presence brought<br />
A glow and radiance from the realms unseen.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hand clasped with hand, in silence for a
space<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Centuries sat; the sad old eyes of one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (As grave paternal eyes regard a son)<br />
Gazing upon that other eager face.<br />
And then a voice, as cadenceless and gray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sea&rsquo;s monody in winter time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mingled with tones melodious, as the chime<br />
Of bird choirs, singing in the dawns of May.</p>

Staggers, bruised and torn and wounded by a derelict of fate,<br

One that drifted from its moorings in the anchorage of hate.</p>

Victim of a mind self-centred in a Godless fool of crime.</p>

Close beside the deathless Lincoln, writ in light, will shine his

10</span>GRIEF</h2>
<p class="poetry">As the funeral train with its honoured dead<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; On its mournful way went sweeping,<br />
While a sorrowful nation bowed its head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the whole world joined in weeping,<br />
I thought, as I looked on the solemn sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the one fond heart despairing,<br />
And I said to myself, as in truth I might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How sad must be this

<p class="poetry">To share the living with even Fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a heart that is only human,<br />
Is hard, when Glory asserts her claim<br />

Yet a great, grand passion can put aside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or stay each selfish emotion,<br />
And watch, with a pleasure that springs from pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its rival&mdash;the world&rsquo;s devotion.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; While even her <i>dead</i> was borrowed;<br />
Borrowed from her, the bride&mdash;the wife&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the world&rsquo;s last martial honour,<br />
As she sat in the gloom of her darkened life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With her widow&rsquo;s grief fresh upon her.</p>
<p class="poetry">He had shed the glory of Love and Fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a golden halo about her;<br />
She had shared his triumphs and worn his name:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, alas! he had died without her.<br />
He had wandered in many a distant realm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never had left her behind him,<br />
But now, with a spectral shape at the helm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had sailed where she could not find him.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was only a thought, that came that day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the muffled drumming<br />
And funeral music and sad display,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I knew was right and becoming<br />
Only a thought as the mourning train<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved, column after column,<br />
Bearing the dead to the burial plain<br />

<p class="poetry">A lovely little keeper of the home,<br />
Absorbed in menu books, yet erudite<br />

And slow to anger.&nbsp; Modest as a flower,<br />

Unmercenary in her mould of mind,<br />
While opulent and dainty in her tastes.<br />
A nature generous and free, albeit<br />
The incarnation of economy.<br />
She must be chaste as proud Diana was,<br />
Yet warm as Venus.&nbsp; To all others cold<br />
As some white glacier glittering in the sun;<br />
To me as ardent as the sensuous rose<br />

Eternity for telling, and our best<br />
Development comes ever through your praise,<br />
As through our praise you reach your highest self?<br />
Oh! had you not been miser of your praise<br />
And let our virtues be their own reward,<br />
The old-established order of the world<br />
Would never have been changed.&nbsp; Small blame is ours<br />
For this unsexing of ourselves, and worse.<br />
Effeminising of the male.&nbsp; We were<br />
Content, sir, till you starved us, heart and brain.<br />
All we have done, or wise, or otherwise,<br />
Traced to the root, was done for love of you.<br />
Let us taboo all vain comparisons,<br />
And go forth as God meant us, hand in hand,<br />
Companions, mates, and comrades evermore;<br />
Two parts of one divinely ordained whole.</p>

They need not rush in front of death-charged guns<br />
With murder in their hearts to prove their worth.<br />
The grandest heroes who have graced the earth<br />
Were love-filled souls who did not seek the fray,<br />
But chose the safe, hard, high, and lonely way<br />
Of selfless labour for a suffering world.<br />
Beneath our glorious flag again unfurled<br />

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The times are not
degenerate.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s faith<br />
Mounts higher than of old.&nbsp; No crumbling creed<br />
Can take from the immortal soul the need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of that supreme Creator, God.&nbsp; The wraith<br />
Of dead beliefs we cherished in our youth<br />
Fades but to let us welcome new-born Truth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man may not worship at the
ancient shrine<br />
Prone on his face, in self-accusing scorn.<br />
That night is past.&nbsp; He hails a fairer morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knows himself a something all divine;<br />
Not humble worm whose heritage is sin,<br />
But, born of God, he feels the Christ withal.</p>

Through all our search for worldly gains and treasures,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There walketh one whom no man likes to name.<br />
Silent he follows, veiled of form and feature,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Indifferent if we sorrow or rejoice,<br />
Yet that day comes when every living creature<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must look upon his face and hear his voice.</p>
<p class="poetry">When that day comes to you, and Death,
unmasking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall bar your path, and say, &ldquo;Behold the
end,&rdquo;<br />
What are the questions that he will be asking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About your past?&nbsp; Have you considered,
friend?<br />
I think he will not chide you for your sinning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor for your creeds or dogmas will he care;<br />
He will but ask, &ldquo;From your life&rsquo;s first beginning<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; How many burdens have you helped to bear?&rdquo;</p>

For many a year, and filled my heart with dread.<br />
Yet fickle joys, like false, pretentious friends,<br />

Trod only by the feet that know fatigue,<br />
And yet press on until the heights appear.</p>

staff<br />
Of close communion with the over-soul,<br />
That I might lean upon it to the end,<br />
And find myself made strong for any strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then these three who had pursued my

Like stern, relentless foes, year after year,<br />
Unmasked, and turned their faces full on me,<br />

Of sharp December pierce the heart of June,<br />
What death and devastation would ensue!<br />
All things are planned.&nbsp; The most majestic sphere<br />
That whirls through space is governed and controlled<br />
By supreme law, as is the blade of grass<br />
Which through the bursting bosom of the earth<br />
Creeps up to kiss the light.&nbsp; Poor, puny man<br />
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Alone
doth strive and battle with the Force<br />
Which rules all lives and worlds, and he alone<br />
Demands effect before producing cause.<br />
How vain the hope!&nbsp; We cannot harvest joy<br />
Until we sow the seed, and God alone<br />
Knows when that seed has ripened.&nbsp; Oft we stand<br />
And watch the ground with anxious, brooding eyes,<br />
Complaining of the slow, unfruitful yield,<br />
Not knowing that the shadow of ourselves<br />
Keeps off the sunlight and delays result.<br />
Sometimes our fierce impatience of desire<br />
Doth like a sultry May force tender shoots<br />
Of half-formed pleasures and unshaped events<br />
To ripen prematurely, and we reap<br />
But disappointment; or we rot the germs<br />
With briny tears ere they have time to grow.<br />
While stars are born and mighty planets die<br />
And hissing comets scorch the brow of space,<br />
The Universe keeps its eternal calm.<br />
Through patient preparation, year on year,<br />
The earth endures the travail of the Spring<br />
And Winter&rsquo;s desolation.&nbsp; So our souls<br />
In grand submission to a higher law<br />
Should move serene through all the ills of life<br />
Believing them masked joys.</p>

<p class="poetry">In golden youth when seems the earth<br />
A Summer-land of singing mirth,<br />
When souls are glad and hearts are light,<br />
And not a shadow lurks in sight,<br />
We do not know it, but there lieu<br />
Somewhere veiled under evening skies<br />
A garden which we all must see&mdash;<br />
The garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p class="poetry">With joyous steps we go our ways,<br />
Love lends a halo to our days;<br />
Light sorrows sail like clouds afar,<br />
We laugh, and say how strong we are.<br />
We hurry on; and hurrying, go<br />
Close to the borderland of woe<br />
That waits for you, and waits for me&mdash;<br />
Forever waits Gethsemane.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Bridged over by our broken dreams;<br />
Behind the misty caps of years,<br />
Beyond the great salt fount of tears,<br />
The garden lies.&nbsp; Strive as you may,<br />
You cannot miss it in your way;<br />
All paths that have been, or shall be,<br />
Pass somewhere through Gethsemane.</p>
<p class="poetry">All those who journey, soon or late,<br />
Must pass within the garden&rsquo;s gate;<br />
Must kneel alone in darkness there,<br />
And battle with some fierce despair.<br />
God pity those who cannot say,<br />
&ldquo;Not mine but Thine&rdquo;; who only pray<br />
&ldquo;Let this cup pass,&rdquo; and cannot see<br />
The <i>purpose</i> in Gethsemane.</p>

Who is all Love, or Nothing.</p>

His great Creator&rsquo;s standard, though he dwells<br />
Outside the pale of churches, and knows not<br />
A feast-day from a fast-day, or a line<br />
Of Scripture even.&nbsp; What God wants of us<br />
Is that outreaching bigness that ignores<br />
All littleness of aims, or loves, or creeds,<br />
And clasps all Earth and Heaven in its embrace.</p>

<p class="poetry">An artist toiled over his pictures;<br />

He struggled for glory and honour<br />

It showed not the splendour of colours<br />

161</span>How could your pity find a place<br />
For us, the mothers of the race?<br />
Men may be fathers unaware,<br />
So poor the title is you wear.</p>
<p class="poetry">But mothers&mdash;who that crown adorns<br />
Knows all its mingled blooms and thorns,<br />
And she whose feet that pain hath trod<br />
Hath walked upon the heights with God.</p>
<p class="poetry">No, offer us not pity&rsquo;s cup.<br />
There is no looking down or up<br />
Between us; eye looks straight in eye:<br />
Born equals, so we live and die.</p>

WOMAN&rsquo;S ANSWER</h2>
<p class="poetry">You call me an angel of love and of light,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A being of goodness and heavenly fire,<br />
Sent out from God&rsquo;s kingdom to guide you aright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In paths where your spirit may mount and aspire,<br
/>
You say that I glow like a star on its course,<br />
Like a ray from the altar, a spark from the source.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now list to my answer&mdash;let all the world
hear it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I speak unafraid what I know to be true&mdash;<br />
A pure, faithful love is the creative spirit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which make women angels!&nbsp; I live but in you.<br
/>
We are bound soul to soul by life&rsquo;s holiest laws;<br />
If I am an angel&mdash;why, you are the cause.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>As my ship skims the sea, I look up from the deck.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair, firm at the wheel shines Love&rsquo;s
beautiful form.<br />
And shall I curse the bark that last night went to wreck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the pilot abandoned to darkness and storm?<br />
My craft is no stauncher, she too had been lost<br />
Had the wheelman deserted, or slept at his post.</p>
<p class="poetry">I laid down the wealth of my soul at your
feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Some woman does this for some man every day).<br />
No desperate creature who walks in the street<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a wickeder heart than I might have, I say,<br />
Had you wantonly misused the treasures you won&mdash;<br />
As so many men with heart-riches have done.</p>
<p class="poetry">This fire from God&rsquo;s altar, this holy
love-flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That burns like sweet incense forever for you,<br />
Might now be a wild conflagration of shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had you tortured my heart, or been base or
untrue.<br />
For angels and devils are cast in one mould,<br />
Till love guides them upward or downward, I hold.</p>
<p class="poetry">I tell you the women who make fervent wives<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sweet tender mothers, had Fate been less
fair,<br />
Are the women who might have abandoned their lives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the madness that springs from and ends in
despair.<br />
As the fire on the hearth which sheds brightness around,<br />
Neglected, may level the walls to the ground.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>The world makes grave errors in judging these
things.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great good and great evil are born in one breast:<br
/>
Love horns us and hoofs us, or gives us our wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the best could be worst, as the worst could be
best.<br />
You must thank your own worth for what I grew to be,<br />
For the demon lurked under the angel in me.</p>
<h2>THE WORLD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p class="poetry">So many gods, so many creeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So many paths that wind and wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While just the art of being kind,<br />
Is all the sad world needs.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
